Once
such
legislation
has
been
promulgated
into
law
by
the
president
,
wrote
Liu
,
it
must
be
implemented
unless
it
is
vetoed
by
the
Cabinet
.

After
the
term
extension
was
declared
invalid
,
retaliatory
constitutional
amendments
were
proposed
in
the
National
Assembly
to
abolish
the
Council
of
Grand
Justices
and
strip
the
justices
of
their
lifetime
stipends
.

Is
there
a
north
-
south
divide
between
Taipei
and
the
other
counties
and
cities
?

Of
the
remaining
,
10
can
be
found
in
the
Hsinchu
Science
Park
.

Although
Taipei
remained
the
political
and
economic
center
,
Kaohsiung
remained
as
an
important
center
of
heavy
industry
.

They
had
visions
of
Taichung
establishing
important
links
to
the
Asia
Pacific
or
even
to
the
global
community
.

Otherwise
,
if
the
"
southern
science
park
"
that
is
now
being
built
in
Tainan
County
is
successful
,
perhaps
it
,
in
combination
with
the
"
three
direct
links
"
and
the
high
-
speed
railway
will
create
new
opportunity
for
central
and
southern
Taiwan
.

If
these
10,000
people
dislike
Taiwan
,
their
opinions
will
get
passed
around
by
word
of
mouth
when
they
return
home
.

The
ROC
government
insists
on
casting
aside
the
Hanyu
Pinyin
system
that
has
been
used
on
the
mainland
and
around
the
world
for
many
years
and
instead
adopting
the
Tongyong
Pinyin
system
,
which
has
been
specially
created
by
a
Taiwanese
scholar
.

He
did
so
to
show
that
he
bore
no
grudge
,
but
perhaps
his
statement
was
also
a
harbinger
of
the
current
animosity
between
the
President
's
Office
and
City
Hall
.

Because
he
knows
that
his
hometown
needs
people
like
him
to
come
back
and
work
on
its
behalf
,
he
really
feels
torn
.

While
Taipei
has
National
Taiwan
University
and
National
Chengchi
University
,
distant
Nantou
has
National
Chi
Nan
University
and
Chiayi
has
Chung
Cheng
University
,
both
of
which
also
have
first
-
rate
faculties
and
curriculums
.

Ou
Chin
-
te
admits
that
Taipei
has
hardly
any
high
-
level
ties
to
other
cities
and
counties
.

Perhaps
the
most
optimistic
view
was
expressed
by
Ruan
Ming
,
a
visiting
professor
at
Tamkang
University
's
Department
of
China
Studies
who
in
the
1980s
was
an
assistant
to
former
Chinese
Communist
Secretary
General
Hu
Yaobang
.

He
feels
that
the
mainland
authorities
face
many
more
pressing
issues
than
Taiwan
,
and
that
the
current
tension
basically
stems
from
President
Lee
Teng
-
hui
's
pronouncement
on
state
-
to
-
state
relations
.

Nevertheless
,
the
two
sides
view
each
other
with
suspicion
.

Not

are

up
to

at
the
roadside
stalls
selling
traditional
Chinese
holiday
paraphernalia
,
such
as

and

on

If
one
of
these

steps
down

is

Big
Managers
on
Campus

Last
year
,
National
Taiwan
University
of
Science
and
Technology
-LRB-
NTUST
-RRB-
opened
the
doors
of
five
of
its
graduate
schools
to
professionals
in
the
workforce
.

In
order
to
accommodate
professionals
with
day
jobs
,
many
universities
have
scheduled
their
business
management
courses
during
evening
hours
.

For
instance
,
National
Chengchi
University
's
Public
Administration
Center
has
offered
graduate
extension
courses
for
executives
for
over
a
decade
,
the
difference
being
that
,
upon
completion
of
the
curriculum
students
only
receive
a
certificate
of
course
credit
.

She
is
thankful
that
her
son
,
a
university
student
,
and
her
daughter
,
a
third
-
year
junior
high
school
student
,
have
always
been
very
independent
and
self
-
reliant
.

Students
who
have
been
away
from
the
classroom
for
well
over
a
decade
can
not
be
expected
to
remember
all
the
formulas
they
learned
in
statistics
and
economics
classes
way
back
when
.

With
these
changes
,
universities
must
not
only
take
care
of
teaching
and
research
,
but
must
also
make
sure
they
play
their
third
function
properly
-
spreading
knowledge
and
sharing
it
with
the
public
.

Thus
,
when
it
comes
down
to
calculating
costs
,
NT$
10,000
per
credit
is
actually
quite
cheap
.

Lastly
,
speaking
the
professional
lingo
fluently
helps
enhance
his
authority
.

The
task
of
rebuilding
is
the
hard
part
.

People
can
see
that
they
are
not
alone
in
their
suffering
,
and
that
they
must
address
their
situation
from
a
collective
standpoint
instead
of
chasing
after
individual
problems
one
at
a
time
.

The

an
excellent

Do
you
remember
?

But
you
've
got
to
find
a
way
to
get
everybody
working
together
so
you
can
actually
get
something
done
,
otherwise
all
talk
about
local
affairs
wo
n't
amount
to
anything
more
than
people
doing
a
bit
of
idle
chatting
and
complaining
around

dinner
table

Located
in
the
center
of
Peipu
,
Tzu

tien
Temple
is
the
town
's
main
landmark
and
features
a
big
open
area
that
is
excellent
for
holding
various
activities
.

Amidst
a
festive
atmosphere
,
the
athletes
entered
the
stadium
by
categories
-
one
group
in

,
another
on
crutches
,
another
led
by

.

During
the
festivities
,
which
were
both
moving
and
fun
,
tribal
elders
sang
warrior
songs
and
praised
Chiang
for
his
glorious
deeds
.

There
are
a
number
of
different
applications
,
including
oil
massages
,
fragrant
baths

and
heating
of

over

to
diffuse

Ho
Tsung

a
doctor
of

Chinese

,
says
that
Chinese
medicine
has
long
included
some

theoretically

the
medicinal

Macau
and

:
so
near
and
yet
so
far

Everything
seemed
smooth
and
orderly

"
Which

"
asks
Tan
.

A
consensus
among
the
Taiwanese
living

working
in
Macau
is
that
"
you
ca
n't
use
ideology
to
decide
what

"

During
much
of
the
Ming

when

officially
banned
,
Macau
was
the

To
the
outsider
,
however
,
the
place
does
n't
look
backward
at
all
.

"
We
had
to
pay
taxes
twice
a
year
,
"
says
grandma
Wu
,
flashing
a
mouthful
of
dental
work
.

Within
half
a
year
both
of
her
adoptive
parents
died
,
and
at
age
11
she
slipped
and
fell
in
the
sugar
cane
fields
,
poking
her
left
eye
out
.

But
,
says
Chien
-
lo
,
"
I
only
had
a
grade

Where
should
Chinese
music
go
?

Studying
at
Chienkuo
High
in
1949
,
he
was
arrested
on
false
charges
of
having
participated
in
the
April
6
Incident
.

Back
in
the
1960s
,
when
Taiwanese
history
was
still
a
taboo
subject
in
Taiwan
,
Tai
organized
a
research
society
in
Japan
devoted
to
the
study
of
Taiwanese
history
and
other
related
Asian
topics
.

Apart
from
causing
us
to
mourn
,
the
deaths
of
these
great
men
have
left
us
with
a
lot
to
think
about
.

Three
out
of
the
four
main
broadcast
stations
are
showing
prime
-
time
Taiwanese
drama
,
and
these
are
pulling
in
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
the
viewing
audience
.

Rather
this
kind
of
thing
is
a
"
trademark
"
that
has
become
attached
to
Taiwanese
drama
over
the
course
of
its
history
.

However
,
because
the
plot
was
realistic
,
ratings
were
unprecedented
,
and
Love
even
defeated
Widow
's
Watch
,
based
on
a
novel
by
,
and
also
produced
by
,
the
vastly
popular
romance
writer
Chiung
Yao
,
and
broadcast
on
CTV
.

Ko
Yu
-
fen
states
that
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
these
trends
against
the
backdrop
of
society
at
that
time
.

No
wonder
it
was
so
successful
.
"

Not
only
has
this
format
given
new
life
to
Taiwanese
drama
,
it
has
also
pioneered
an
entirely
new
type
of
television
drama
-
contemporary
realism
.

The
success
of
serials
means
that
TV
stations
in
Taiwan
just
keep
on
cranking
them
out
,
broadcasting
episodes
as
quickly
as
they
are
shot
.

The
only
solution
is
through
restructuring
of
the
content
,
strengthening
the
rhythms
,
reducing
the
use
of
pointless
patter
to
draw
out
the
series
,
improving
the
dramatic
structure
,
and
adding
new
vitality
to
the
roles
.
"

Taiwan
television
drama
,
on
the
other
hand
,
has
conflict
and
intensity
,
and
if
it
is
well
packaged
,
it
should
do
well
in
the
overseas
market
.

The
advantage
is
that
the
story
can
be
changed
or
the
series
extended
or
shortened
depending
upon
ratings
.

The
stunning

Careful

that
about
90
"
master
craftsmen
"
participated
in
the
making

each
supported
by
a
team

There
are
many
competing
explanations
on
this
score
.

I
'm
doing
this
for
you

While
many
consider
Hsu
's
approach
a
very
enlightened
one
,
there
is
no
denying
that
at
the
gut
level
the
influence
of
mainland
Chinese
culture
rubs
the
wrong
way

in
the
fact

Dear
compatriots
,
400
years
ago
Taiwan
was
called
"
Ihla
Formosa
"
-
the
beautiful
island
-
for
its
lustrous
landscape
.

We
do
not
need
to
wait
further
because
there
is
a
new
opportunity
now
for
the
two
sides
to
create
an
era
of
reconciliation
together
.

Today
,
as
the
son
of
a
tenant
farmer
with
a
poor
family
background
,
I
have
struggled
and
grown
on
this
land
and
,
after
experiencing
defeat
and
tribulation
,
I
have
finally
won
the
trust
of
the
people
to
take
up
the
great
responsibility
of

This
great
wall
of
trees
acts
as
a
vital
"
safety
valve
,
"
regulating
the
flow
of
water
into
the
Shihmen
Reservoir
,
the
Tanshui
River
and
the
Lanyang
River
,
on
which
millions
of
people
in
northern
Taiwan
depend
for
the
water
they
drink
.

There
they
gradually
grew
into
gigantic
trees
,
rehabilitating
the
land
and
attracting
other
species
.

The
logging
grounds
advanced
deep
into
Taiwan
's
heart
,
consuming
even
greater
areas
than
under
the
Japanese
.

And
when
the
railways
were
finally
taken
out
of
service
,
<ENAMEX

Taiwan

sold
off
the
old
sleepers
,
and
from
the
proceeds
not
only
was
able
to
recoup
the
cost
of
dismantling
the
railways
,
but
was
also
left
with
a
tidy
sum
for
its
own
coffers
.

But
the
great
wall
of
20
million
gigantic
false
cypress
trees
which
once
stretched
the
length
of
Taiwan
had
already
been
breached
.

If
that
was
the
case
,
my
wife
and
I
had
a
serious
problem
on
our
hands
.

It
took
Martine
to
remind
us
that
short
,
sharp
pains
are
better
than
long
,
drawn
-
out
suffering
.

She
told
my
wife
that
she
had
been
a
nurse
and
that
taking
Chien
-
chien
home
in
the
cold
night
air
might
worsen
her
chill
.

In
line
with
the
old
saying
"
the
newborn
calf
does
n't
know
that
it
should
fear
the
tiger
,
"
the
new
government
has
been
especially
active
on
the
diplomatic
front
.

In
terms
of
its
relationships
with
the
US
and
Japan
,
mainland
China
makes
the
"
Taiwan
problem
"
a
top
priority
.

While
the
PRC
is
deeply
involved
in
Taiwan
's
relationship
with
the
US
,
it
has
an
even
more
immediate
target
:
to
break
Taiwan
's
formal
diplomatic
relationships
,
which
give
Taiwan
the
status
of
a
sovereign
country
.

Former
foreign
minister
Jason
Hu
defends
foreign
aid
by
arguing
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
countries
in
the
world
:
those
that
help
and
those
that
need
help
.

This
was
clearly
an
effort
to
use
commercial
incentives
to
force
the
Costa
Rican
government
's
hand
.

How
much
room
to
maneuver
does
Taiwan
have
in
this
respect
?

Joanne
Chang
of
the
Academia
Sinica
says
that
although
most
people
feel
that
the
new
government
's
strategies
-
"
diplomacy
of
the
whole
people
,
"
economic
diplomacy
,
and
entry
into
nongovernmental
organizations
-
differ
little
from
the
past
,
you
must
remember
that
diplomacy
is
a
long
-
term
game
,
and
,
in
the
details
,
the
new
foreign
policy
team
has
already
brought
in
some
fresh
air
.

Based
on
his
comments
,
analysts
infer
that
Taiwan
may
in
the
near
future
establish
formal
diplomatic
relations
with
another
European
country
.

For
Teng
,
these
materials
were
priceless
treasures
.

Thereafter
,
whenever
he
had
any
spare
time
he
would
go
visit
the
aborigines
and
chat
with
the
old
folks
.

If
it
had
n't
been
for
Teng
's
detailed
knowledge
of
the
kinship
ties
in
some
clans
,
the
researchers
would
never
have
been

in

to

for

Later
,
when
Han
Chinese
began
trickling
across
to
Taiwan
,
they
mainly
settled
along
rivers
.

The
sounds
of
backhoes
at
work
resounded
even
from
the
black
sand
beaches
.

He
adds
,
in
a
far
less
amused
tone
,
that
the
government
has
been
talking
about
making
Mt.
Kuanyin
a
national
park
for
a
long
time
,
and
has
banned
construction
or
use
of
the
mountain
.

"
But
the
government
should
think
carefully
about
whether
they
are
using
the
right
methods
or
not
.

Pali
produces
wax
apples
,
green
bamboo
shoots
,
and
wendan
pomelo
which
are
famous
far
and
wide
for
their
delicate
texture
and
sweetness
.

Amid
today
's
sweeping
tide
of
modernization
,
Spring
Festival
is
probably
the
only
annual
occasion
left
with
a
truly
"
Chinese
"
flavor
.

The
timing
of
Chinese
New
Year
is
determined
by
the
traditional
lunar
calendar
and
marks
an
important
transition
,
the
point
when
Winter
gives
way
to
Spring
.

Come
New
Year
,
the
children
were
always
attracted
by
the
unusually
busy
atmosphere
in
the
kitchen
,
and
loved
running
in
and
out
to
check
on
what
was
going
on
,
meanwhile
getting
under
everyone
's
feet
.

This
was
especially
so
given
that
the
"
close
of
the
year
"
was
also
the
time
when
creditors
turned
up
to
claim
their
dues
and
"
close
"
their
accounts
.

"
The
most
scary
thing
is
the
deep
-
seated
clan
mentality
of
the
Chinese
,
"
says
Li
Yuan
,
an
author
known
for
his
writings
on
the
topic
of
family
.

His
authority
lay
in
tatters
,
long
since
torn
down
by
his
adult
offspring
.

New
Year
was
the
only
time
when
we
got
to
bring
bulging
bags
and
packages
back
to
the
house
.

"
It
's
a
way
of
measuring
whether
I
've
achieved
my
objectives
,
in
my
work
and
in
my
personal
maturity
.

It
's
a
homeland
of
the
soul
for
every
one
of
us
.

"
Earning
money
is
the
first
priority
,
spending
money
is
a
sin
,
long
live
personal
money
management
!
"

Some
investment
websites
have
games
for
children
to
teach
them
about
various
investment
instruments
and
portfolios
.

It
was
seen
as
a
"
cannibalistic
market
"
which
scared
off
most
citizens
.

Next
,
increased
cross-strait
tensions
put
a
further
damper
on
the
property
market
.

Telecommunications
,
Internet
,
and
biotechnology
stocks
soared
.

The
story
goes
that
there
was
an
old
grandmother
who
followed
the
crowd
in
and
out
of
the
stock
,
earning
a
huge
amount
in
the
process
.

It
seems
they
have
n't
realized
yet
that
they
may
live
to
be
85
.

He
even
mortgaged
his
house
and
persuaded
his
friends
to
invest
with
him
.

Alas
,
he
put
his
faith
in
the
predictions
of
a
certain
investment
adviser
,
and
put
everything
he
had
into
securities
stocks
,
which
stagnated
.

It
is
said
that
the
two
biggest
causes
of
family
arguments
this
year
have
been
differences
over
who
to
vote
for
in
the
presidential
election
,
and
over
what
stocks
to
buy
.

Live
well
at
every
stage
of
life

To
assume
a
posture
of
superiority
based
on
one
's
seniority
will
make
one
despised
.

Many
middle
-
aged
people
begin
to
ask
themselves
,
"
Is
this
really
what
I
want
?

When
focusing
inward
,
many
dreams
that
have
long
been
discarded
will
end
up
floating
to
the
surface
.

And
you
can
help
to
sweat
off
your
middle
-
aged
anxieties
by
making
a
habit
of
regularly
exercising
.

At
the
very
least
,
you
've
got
to
work
hard
at
establishing
a
sense
of
direction
.

Is
life
getting
you
down
?

Last
December
,
at
a
seminar
at
the
Armed
Forces
University
entitled
"
Transmillennial
National
Security
and
Military
Strategy
,
"
Lien
delivered
an
address
entitled
"
National
Defense
Strategy
and
Construction
in
the
New
Century
.
"

Lt.
Gen.
Fuh
Wei
-
ku
,
commandant
of
the
Air
Command
and
General
Staff
College
at
the
Armed
Forces
University
,
notes
that
for
the
moment
Taiwan
still
has
a
slight
edge
in
terms
of
air
defense
.

He
says
that
if
Taiwan
were
to
join
the
TMD
this
would
be
a
return
to
a
situation
of
joint
US
-
Taiwan
defense
,
such
as
existed
during
the
Cold
War
,
when
Taiwan
was
on
the
frontline
in
a
chain
of
islands
surrounding
China
.

Even
if
missile
defense
could
be
99
%
effective
,
and
only
one
percent
of
attacking
missiles
got
through
,
the
situation
could
still
be
a
total
loss
.

For
pilots
to
qualify
for
the
new
aircraft
,
they
must
have
at
least
400
hours
of
flying
experience
.

Doctrine
,
not
weapons

This
is
a
key
area
of
development
for
the
future
in
which
Taiwan
can
rely
on
itself
and
need
not
be
limited
by
what
can
be
procured
abroad
.

A
number
of
victims
and
their
family
members
also
attended
the
ceremony
,
at
which
they
presented
a
petition
on
behalf
of
more
than
10,000
victims
of
political
terror
whose
names
can
not
be
inscribed
on
the
wall
because
of
lack
of
official
documentation
of
their
cases
.

Hardly
worth
teaching
!
"

This
they
duly
did
,
digging
a
pit
and
burying
the
boy
alive
.

However
,
Chen
Pi
-
yun
provided
no
reasonable
explanation
of
the
key
question
:
Why
were
public
funds
mixed
up
with
and
deposited
along
with
private
funds
in
the
Soong
family
's
private
accounts
?

This
in
turn
sparked
Soong
to
ask
Hsieh
Chi
-
ta
for
another
audit
.

However
,
the
controversy
over
the
plant
was
soon
put
back
in
the
spotlight
by
calls
for
a
plebiscite
on
the
issue
.

But
before
that
the
11
private
power
stations
already
approved
for
construction
should
be
completed
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
if
2,000
megawatts
of
substitute
generating
capacity
could
be
completed
,
the
three
older
nuclear
plants
could
be
decommissioned
early
.

However
,
by
her
second
and
third
terms
,
she
came
very
much
into
her
own
,
and
she
won
great
respect
from
women
's
groups
as
a
defender
of
women
's
interests
and
a
champion

Now
is
the
chance
to
clear
out
the
cobwebs
and
get
off
to
a
new
start
.
"

Thus
we
gained
a
great
deal
from
attending
.

Hence
in
our
future
approach
to
the
UN
,
besides
continuing
to
press
for
admission
by
mobilizing
our
diplomatic
partners
to
speak
on
our
behalf
,
we
should
also
actively
seek
to
make
the
most
of
the
power
of
our
people
.

How
do
the
people
of
Tanshui
live
today
?

Here
they
engaged
in
barter
trade
with
the
Pingpu
-LRB-
meaning
"

"
-RRB-
aborigines
,
with
deer
skins
and
sulphur
being
the
most
coveted
products
.

During
the
reign
of
the
Guangxu
emperor
of
the
Qing
dynasty
-LRB-
which
began
in
1875
-RRB-
,
and
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
Japanese
occupation
in
1895
,
Tanshui
produced
two
successful
candidates
in
the
highest
level
military
exam
,
one
in
the
highest
level
civil
exam
,
and
countless
successes
in
lower

exams

In
the
old
bamboo
tea
shop
,
the

hostess
still
plays
her
role
amidst
the
ambience

,
offering
a
feminine
presence
to
help
put
at
ease
her
customers
who
come
looking
for
a
little
relaxation
,
evoking
the
bewitching
atmosphere
of
Tanshui
at
night
.

It
's
such
a
beautiful
and
historic
location
,
but
they
are
just
going
to
stick
up
a
bridge
there
,
and
they
are
even
talking
about
having

Rights

Also
,
now
that
the
regulations
for
establishing
new
towns
have
been
revised
,
the
proposed
plan
to
build
a
mass
transit
line
to
the
airport
by
the
Chang
Yi
financial
group
can
become
reality
.

A
single
unified
body
with
sufficient
rank
is
necessary
to
integrate
these
functions
with
coastal
and
shoreline
law
enforcement
and
fishing
harbor
inspections
.

Also
,
in
the
future
,
whole
historic
settlements
or
streets
can
be
considered
monuments
to
be
preserved
.

"
By
the
morning
of
the
third
day
we
start
up
again
with
three
shifts
,
just
like
any
other
day
.

Chang
Han
-
wen
,
the
chairman
of
the
Taiwan
Business
Association
of
Dongguan
-LRB-
TBAD
-RRB-
,
says
that
development
started
in
the
late
1980s
.

Qishi
's
factory
rents
,
electricity
charges
and
land
leases
were
all
focuses
of
discussion
.

And
the
second
key
is
that
when
you
deal
with
Taiwanese
companies
,
you
do
n't
have
to
endure
a
long
contract
process
.

"
It
does
n't
cost
much
to
set
up
a
factory
in
mainland
China
,
and
shipping
times
are
stable
.

But
since
she
's
moved
the
factory
,
"
there
has
n't
been
a
single
meal
the
whole
family
has
eaten
together
.
"

"
But
we
felt
that
the
service
left
something
to
be
desired
,
and
that
a
lot
of
time
would
always
be
wasted
while
holders
of
'
Taiwanese
Compatriot
Visas
'
cleared
customs
,
"
notes
David
Chang
,
Global
Travel
Holding
's
executive
director
.

"
The
student
then
challenges
the
master
,
"
explains
Sylvia
Yang
,
detailing
how
these
mainland
upstarts
go
on
to
compete
with
the
very
Taiwan
firms
that
taught
them
all
they
know
.

I
'm
meditating
and
have
gone
vegetarian
,
but
I
'm
still
not
at
peace
,
"
Yeh
says
.

Chang
notes
that
after
the
major
earthquake
in
Taiwan
on
September
21
,
Taiwan
business
associations
throughout
mainland
China
contributed
NT$
60
million
.

The
winner
of
the
prize
for
fine
art
in
last
year
's
National
Culture
and
Arts
Foundation
Awards
-
one
of
the
highest
honors
for
an
artist
in
Taiwan
-
was
contemporary
painter
Hsia
Yang
.

As
Hsia
recalls
,
the
main
incentive
for
studying
under
Li
Chung
-
sheng
was
that
Li
's
fees
were
relatively
affordable
.

In
his
painting
Flying
Apsaras
,
Hsia
brings
a
modern
geometrical
approach
to
the
traditional
image
of
airborne
Buddhist
spirits
.

It
was
a
case
of
"
seizing
that
special
thing
of
your
own
,
"
which
for
an
artist
is
of
the
utmost
importance
.

She
met
Hsia
through
the
painter
Hsieh
Li
-
fa
,
and
since
then
the
two
of
them
have
shared
a
simple
and
quiet
life
together
.

Hsia
was
fiddling
with
an
aluminum
ring
from
a
broken
hair
-
dryer
,
shaping
it
into
a
little
figure
,
when
the
idea
dawned
of
doing
fuzzy
people
in
solid
form
.

Hsia
's
fuzzy
people
have
taken
on
solid
form
,
sculpted
from
copper
and
iron
.

"
Teacher
Cheng
,
is
there
anything
wrong
?
"
asks
Lu
nervously
.

But
by
that
point
we
had
no
time
to
lose
,
and
it
would
have
been
problematic
to
file
a
retroactive
proposal
.
"

He
previously
worked
on
special
exhibitions
of
Chihshanyen
and
Yuanshan
culture
and
also
for
the
Taiwan
Provincial
Museum
.

She
would
be
an
elegantly
dressed
noblewoman
,
with
brushed
hair
,
and
jewelry
made
from
shells
,
with
perhaps
an
agate
necklace
.
.
.
.

The
stick
would
have
patterns
carved
into
it
which
would
then
be
left
imprinted
on
the
clay
.

Some
also
includes
shells
or
hornblende
.

Though
Cheng
was
able
to
complete
the
full
set
of
prehistoric
pottery
reproductions
requested
by
the
museum
,
and
at
a
level
of
quality
that
received
high
grades
from
the
museum
and
from
consultant
Liu
I
-
chang
,
Cheng
himself
still
feels
there
are
things
that
he
could
have
done
better
.

Now
that
's
a
lovely
thought
.

Administration
Accused
of
Political
Surveillance

The
NSB
also
released
a
statement
stressing
that
the
information
it
collects
is
mostly
related
to
matters
that
affect
national
security
or
pose
a
potential
national
security
threat
.

The
intelligence
apparatus
is
supposedly
subject
to
supervision
by
the
legislature
,
which
wields
budgetary
authority
over
these
agencies
and
has
the
power
to
review
internal
administrative
documents
that
do
not
contain
classified
information
.

After
Tang
took
his
oath
,
he
submitted
his
Cabinet
nominations
to
Chen
for
formal
appointment
.

Japan
's
Foreign
Minister
Yohei
Kono
also
commented
favorably
,
indicating
his
government
's
hope
that
the
two
sides
can
engage
in
dialogue
and
work
for
a
peaceful
resolution
of
the
cross-strait
issue
now
that
the
new
president
has
taken
office
.

Pop
diva
Chang
Hui
-
mei
sang
the
ROC
national
anthem
at
the
inaugural
and
angered
the
Chinese
communists
,
who
reacted
by
pulling
her
long
-
running
Sprite
commercials
from
the
air
and
banning
the
sale
of
her
music
.

Gao
's

artistic
life
extends
beyond
fiction
to
painting
and
theater
.

Soul
Mountain
and
the
flesh

Mediated
by
Taipei
Bureau
of
Cultural
Affairs
director
Lung
Ying
-
tai
,
the
two
held
a
lively
discussion
.

In
dialogue
with
his
grandson
Ah
-
ming
,
the
"
Irrational
Old
Man
"
passes
on
his
old
knowledge
:
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
waves
the
wind
makes
in
the
rice
paddies
to
discover
if
the
rice
is
ripe
;
fill
the
bellies
of
grasshoppers
with
salt
before
grilling
them
;
sparrows
are
ghosts
or
spirits
which
understand
human
speech
;
and
killing
the
lu
ti
bird
brings
floods
.

In
the
extremely
nationalistic
atmosphere
of
the
1970s
,
Huang
changed
his
focus
for
a
time
,
writing
about
the
hatred
of
Japan
-LRB-
Sayonara
,
Goodbye
-RRB-
and
about
anti-American
sentiments
-LRB-
I
Love
Mary
-RRB-
.

Now
,
this
"
generation
gap
"
stands
between
him
and
the
"
implied
reader
"
of
his
fiction
-
children
of
his
grandchildren
's
generation
who
are
ignorant
of
traditional
wisdom
.

However
,
the
most
exceptional
thing
about
Huang
as
a
writer
is
that
he
is
not
satisfied
with
making
his
readers
cry
.

A
Cooling
Economy
Heats
Up
the
Competition

Based
on
a
survey
conducted
by
AC
Nielsen
,
only
about
3
%
of
individuals
buy
newspapers
to
read
the
classified
ads
.

There
is
much
room
for
change
and
flexibility
,
and
no
one
can
guess
how
much
the
market
might
change
,
"
says
1111
public
relations
manager
Linda
Miao
.

The
UDN
group
is
undertaking
a
three
-
pronged
attack
to
crush
their
competition
:
continuing
to
access
the
wide
readership
of
newspapers
,
targeting
the
high
-
tech
sector
through
the
Internet
,
and
using
the
magazine
format
for
regional
companies
with
small
budgets
.

The
"
little
three
links
"
-
direct
mail
,
transport
,
and
commerce
between
the
ROC
islands
of
Kinmen
and
Matsu
on
the
one
side
and
the
PRC
on
the
other
-
were
formally
opened
on
January
2
.

This
could
be
very
significant
in
increasing
exchanges
and
mutual
understanding
between
the
two
sides
.

In
this
year
's
presidential
election
,
cross-strait
policy
is
still
an
important
subject
.

Maintaining
peaceful
relations
across
the
Taiwan
Strait
is
the
common
hope
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
of
Taiwan
.

The
candidates
can
merely
haggle
over
details
of
policy
,
such
as
differences
over
the
scope
or
timing
of
liberalization
of
the
"
three
direct
links
"
-LRB-
direct
trade
,
direct
transport
,
and
direct
mail
-RRB-
.

When
Soong
was
KMT
secretary
-
general
,
he
was
powerful
and
aloof
;
the
only
way
to
get
an
interview
with
him
was
to
block
his
car
as
it
left
party
headquarters
.

Lien
Chan
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
more
like
Al
Gore
,
and
has
always
been
somewhat
aloof
from
average
citizens
.

After
starting
his
career
as
a
lawyer
,
Chen
acted
as
defense
counsel
for
arrested
opposition
leaders
,
and
then
served
several
terms
as
a
legislator
,
making
a
name
for
himself
as
a
standout
leader
of
the
opposition
.

His
platform
includes
subsidies
to
assist
the
children
of
low
-
income
families
who
attend
private
secondary
schools
.

Laws
ca
n't
cover
everything
,
and
always
leave
gray
areas
,
so
that
"
influential
persons
are
positioned
to
undertake
quasi-legal
activities
with
impunity
.

Wang
Chien
-
chuang
states
:
"
All
candidates
have
beautiful
-
sounding
platforms
,
because
this
is
a
presidential
election
,
and
they
must
have
a
blueprint
for
governing
the
nation
.

Lien
must
face
up
to
the
fact
that
his
party
has
been
governing
in
Taiwan
for
50
years
,
and
people
want
change
.

The
greatest
variable
for
Taiwan
society
remains
the
other
side
of
the
Taiwan
Strait
.

Sitting
in
the
silence
of
his
research
office
,
Professor
Li
Liang
-
che
of
the
psychology
department
at
National
Chengchi
University
appears
pensive
.

He
arranged
with
his
young
employees
to
go
for
a
barbecue
in
a
river
valley
,
hoping
to
get
to
know
them
better
.

Midlife
change
,
in
fact
,
is
a
natural
process
in
the
journey
of
life
,
and
as
people
grow
older
and
have
to
shoulder
ever
heavier
responsibilities
,
all
kinds
of
pressures
large
and
small
appear
together
at
this
time
of
life
.

,
lives
in
Kaohsiung
with

Two
years
ago
,
she
became
seriously
depressed
.

"
We
do
n't
constrain
each
other
or
force
each
other
into
anything

Middle

is
a
minefield

downhearted

But
who

my

would

telling

,
you

"

Forty

-
what
an
awkward
age
.

Being
stuck
in
among
a
group
of
young
kids
in
their
twenties
,
and
being
subjected
to
"
shock
style
"
training
-
including
listening
to
pep
talks
,
singing
military
songs
and
shouting
slogans
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
-
made
Lin
feel
very
uncomfortable
.

"
I
would
n't
call
it
success
,
and
it
does
n't
mean
I
do
n't
have
any
struggles
left
in

In
the
last
two
years
,
three
biochip
companies
have
also
been
set
up
in
Taiwan
.

Its
initial
objectives
are
mainly
focused
on
developing
sensor
chips
to
screen
for
infectious
diseases
,
while
later
goals
will
be
to
develop
technologies
to
test
for
genetic
diseases
and
cancers
.

Where
the
real
money
is

Currently
,
TGS
has
its
sights
set
mainly
on
doing
research
into
diseases
which
are
especially
prevalent
in
Asia
,
such
as
liver
and
stomach
cancers
.

In
particular
,
biochips
not
only
can
speed
the
pace
of
research
,
but
can
also
replace
laboratory
animals
such
as
rats
and
rabbits
in
many
experiments
,
with
tests
being
carried
out
directly
on
human
genes
on
the
chip
.

"
Applications
and
commercialization
are
our
goal
,
"
says
Johnsee
Lee
.

Their
audience
of
classmates
breaks
into
laughter
.

Mr.
Chen
lives
in
Neihu
.

As
early
as
1996
,
the
Educational
Reform
Committee
of
the
Executive
Yuan
proposed
that
the
Ministry
of
Education
include
English
in
the
primary
school
curriculum
.

"
We
're
basically
creating
the
same
environment
for
our
children
as
an
American
preschooler
would
have
,
"
says
Shen
Hui
-
lien
,
a
teacher
at
Chunghsing
Primary
School
.

She
could
n't
see
any
other
choice
and
agreed
to
let
him
enroll
at
one
nearby
.

"
Private
language
schools
fill
a
need
for
small
-
group
learning
.
"

These
include
establishing
English
Teaching
Departments
at
teacher
training
colleges
and
supplementary
education
courses
at
tertiary
institutions
,
allowing
graduates
who
intend
to
become
English
teachers
in
primary
schools
to
obtain
official
teaching
qualifications
,
and
providing
further
training
for
qualified
teachers
who
have
never
taught
English
,
to
equip
them
with
appropriate
language
teaching
skills
and
methods
.

As
he
sees
it
,
the
children
must
not
feel
that
learning
English
is
putting
them
under
a
lot
of
pressure
.

Last
year
when
the
inaugural
Polynesian
Cultural
Festival
was
held
in
Taitung
County
,
scholars
and
arts
troupes
from
Palau
were
among
the
participants
.

Many
Taiwan
business
people
saw
the
establishment
of
formal
diplomatic
relations
as
a
green
light
for
investment
in
Palau
.

In
the
air
,
because
Palau
is
a
tropical
ocean
climate
,
and
rains
leave
as
fast
as
they
come
,
tourists
are
often
treated
to
rainbows
.

A
lot
of
tourist
agencies
have
simply
given
up
promoting
this
route
.
"

However
,
though
Tai
has
made
quite
a
name
for
himself
with
his
business
,
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
other
Taiwanese
can
come
and
make
similar
investments
.

Under
Palauan
law
foreigners
are
not
allowed
to
own
land
there
,
but
can
only
lease
land
for
development
.

Lee
's
four
-
day
series
of
closed
-
door
meetings
in
Taiwan
came
to
an
end
on
September
26
.

President
Chen
broke
the
silence
after
Lee
left
,
stating
at
a
function
in
honor
of
model
public
servants
that
he
and
Lee
Kuan
Yew
had
reached
three
agreements
,
namely
that
Singapore
and
Taiwan
should
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
sign
a
"
Singapore
-
Taiwan
Free
Trade
Zone
Agreement
"
;
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
lend
impetus
to
financial
cooperation
,
especially
a
possible
exchange
rate
agreement
;
and
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
effect
telecommunication
and
Internet
alliances
.

To
those
who
knew
him
,
the
late
calligrapher
and
seal
-
carver
Wang
Chuang
-
wei
was
simply
"
Old
Chuang
.
"

Instead
he
opted
for
the
life
of
the
true
Chinese
man
of
letters
.

Thus
it
was
that
he
could
fill
the
confined
space
on
a
seal
with
expansive
,
forceful
-
looking
characters
.

As
a
result
,
his
calligraphy
came
to
combine
fluid
grace
with
a
core
of
doughty
toughness
.

Wang
,
with
his
vast
erudition
and
deep
knowledge
of
painting
,
calligraphy
,
and
inscriptions
,
was
often
sought
out
for
his
views
by
others
in
the
field
of
art
and
culture
.

When
Wang
was
young
he
once
wrote
the
following
lines
on
seeing
the
work
of
an
ancient
master
at
firsthand
:
"
Ink
from
the
brush
of
a
master
gives
one
the
sensation
of
seeing
something
that
is
living
and
breathing
,
flesh
and
blood
.

Wang
carved
each
seal
at
one
go
,
and
his
layout
was
always
very
compact
.

The
"
new
man
"
is
making
himself
over
from
head
to
toe
,
and
is
not
averse
to
showing
a
more
feminine
side
in
doing
so
.

According
to
statistics
from
early
March
2000
from
the
Wanfang
Hospital
Laser
Center
,
last
year
the
ratio
of
men
to
women
going
for
cosmetic
surgery
was
1
:
3
,
compared
to
1
:
5
just
five
years
ago
.

Many
men
have
been
encouraged
by
their
wives
to
get
surgery
to
change
their
single-fold
eyelids
to
double-fold
,
or
to
have
fat
removed
by
liposuction
.

They
can
only
put
down
their
body
armor
after
slugging
a
few
drinks
down
.

It
happens
that
many
modern
guys
who
go
in
for
dressing
up
are
also
showing
a
trend
toward
androgynous
standards
of
beauty
.

Many
in
that
field
are
crossing
traditional
barriers
between
male
and
female
.

With
a
little
bit
of
muscle
,
your
clothes
look
even
better
.
"

As
she
sees
it
,
young
people
are
no
more
vain
now
than
they
were
in
the
past
.

Wang
Hao
-
wei
notes
that
in
this
generation
people
are
increasingly
forced
into
situations
in
which
appearance
matters
-
for
example
,
on
the
lecture
podium
,
or
in
front
of
the
TV
camera
or
the
camera
lens
.

And
many
government
officials
who
often
appear
on
TV
have
been
patients
in
her
cosmetic
surgery
clinic
.

Ning
Yin
-
bin
assumes
that
as
men
and
women
compete
in
corporeal
beauty
,
some
balance
will
be
reached
,
without
going
to
extremes
.

The
Dutch
brought
it
to
Taiwan
from
Java
,
in
the
17th
century
,
and
it
became
commonly
grown
as
a
shade
-
giving
tree
.

Wu
Wu
-
ta
,
a
plumber
who
runs
the
Democracy
Association
,
says
:
"
People
were
already
doing
their
bit
for
the
community
over
ten
years
ago
,
but
not
openly
.

This
was
the
thinking
behind
Tsao
's
gathering
together
of
various
groups
for
the
Wax
Apple
Festival
.

Will
this
bring
more
prosperity
to
the
area
?

money

by

At

John
Pomfret
,
bureau
chief
of
the
Washington
Post
,
points
out
that
,
after
a
long
era
of
rule
by
virtually
unchallenged
leaders
,
the
electorate
is
looking
for
more
choice
.

But
today
times
have
changed
,
and
so
has
the
constitution
.

James
Soong
,
on
the
other
hand
,
hoping
to
take
advantage
of
the
desire
for
change
,
emphasizes
that
if
he
is
elected
as
a
non-party
candidate
he
will
promote
reforms
which
will
alter
the
roles
of
the
major
parties
.

Therefore
they
have
let
it
be
known
that
Chen
would
like
to
ask
Lee
Yuan

tse
,
the
universally
respected
Nobel
Prize

premier

Observers
are
very
curious
about
whether
the
KMT
has
in
fact
changed
,
or
whether
we
will
see
a
repeat
of
what
happened
back
in
the
late
1970s
:

The
need
for
compromise
could
be
further
increased
by
the
proposed
law
currently
under
discussion
to
put
all
party
assets
in
blind
trust
.

Chang
Chun
-
hung
suggests
that
,
in
addition
to
uncertainty
in
party
politics
,
a
Soong
victory
could
also
bring
instability
to
Taiwan
's
constitutional
system
.

As
a
result
,
Taiwan
's
ethnic
groups
are
pitted
against
one
another
politically
.

What
kind
of
social
changes
does
Taiwan
's
consumer
behavior
reflect
?

According
to
the
Ministry
of
Finance
's
Office
of
Statistics
,
business
in
the
first
quarter
of
2000
for
these
stores
was
up
19.54
%
over
the
same
quarter
the
previous
year
,
a
higher
rate
of
growth
than
for
convenience
stores
,
supermarkets
or
department
stores
.

As
he
catches
his
breath
,
he
says
that
he
never
much
liked
exercise
,
but
that
in
the
half
year
since
joining
the
club
his
life
has
been
dramatically
transformed
.

Alexander

open
to
all
ages
.

While
they
share
the
ambition
of
attracting
more
people
to
their
ranks
,
foreign
chains
nonetheless
take
a
different
approach
.

Rex
,
with
his
many
years
of
training
experience
,
finds
it
especially
notable
that
"
women
in
Taiwan
do
n't
really
go
for
the
American
female
approach
of
developing
muscular
bodies
.

"
People
over
50
or
under
16
can
easily
hurt
themselves
lifting
heavy
weights
,
so
I
tell
people
not
to
be
foolhardy
,

For
Taiwanese
people
,
who
have
questions
about
their
own
identity
and
often
ask
themselves
who
they
are
,
what
thoughts
does
Carlos
Marreiros
's
story
bring
to
mind
?

Ceramic
fibers
,
stainless
steel
,
shrimp
shells
-
at
first
glance
there
seems
to
be
no
connection
with
spinning
and
weaving
.

But
overcapacity
and
shrinking
demand
caused
by
the
crisis
had
hit
the
industry
hard
.

This
aroused
their
interest
in
entering
the
field
.

But
95
%
of
Taiwan
's
textile
firms
are
small
or
medium
-
sized
enterprises
.

Sweat
can
evaporate
through
these
pores
without
being
absorbed
by
the
fabric
,
improving
comfort
compared
with
traditional
hydrophilic
fabrics
which
when
worn
in
the
rain
start
sticking
to
the
body
after
a
time
.

However
,
Shang
does
not
see
this
as
a
viable
long
-
term
strategy
.

These
features
are
unmatched
by
any
of
the
systems
currently
in
common
use
worldwide
,
which
only
define
up
to
3,000
colors
.

The
stainless

fibers
in
the
fabrics
worn
by
these
models
have
potential
applications
not
only
in
avant

fashions
,
but
also
in
industrial
conveyor
belts
and
even
space
suits
.

On

And
he
often

Did
you

90
%
of
the
knowledge
in

has
been
produced
in

this

sitting

writing

Taiwan
currently
ranks
fourth
in
the
world
in
value
of
IT
production
,
and
,
if
you
include
the
plants
established
by
Taiwan
investors
across
the
globe
,
Taiwanese
-
controlled
firms
lead
the
world
in
manufacturing
of

.

This
is
a
classic
"

Kuo
says
that
while
there
has
been
some
improvement
in

with
regard
to
protection
of
intellectual
property
rights
,
there
is
still
not
enough
for
those
who
invest
in
development
and
innovation
.

Of
course
,
to
sell
operational
know-how
,
this
knowledge
must
be
converted
into
steps
,
systems
,

standards
,
and
must
be
well

The
results
so
far
have
been

added
that
he
hoped

shortly
come
to
a

on

A
firm
consensus
was

And
Does

show
that

successfully

"
Dark

Chinese
New
Year
in
the
Southern
Hemisphere

As
more
and
more
Asian
immigrants
arrived
,
members
of
Parliament
-
vying
for
votes
-
began
participating
enthusiastically
in
the
Association
's
events
.

Thomas
Lu
is
the
doyen
of
the
Chinese
news
media
.

If
sincere
,
this
kind
of
action
is
attractive
in
a
man
.

But
do
n't
overdo
it
.

The
team
started
out
using
advanced
equipment
capable
of
detecting
signs
of

There
is
nothing
anyone
can
do
to
prevent

from
occurring
,
but
specialists
have
noted
that
the
consequences
of
the
recent
quakes
were
made
worse
by
man
-
made
factors
,
such
as
overpopulation
,
environmental
degradation
,
and
shoddy
construction
.

Rather
,
what
he
had
at
his
disposal
was
a
method
of
organizing
knowledge

2.
The
company
's
definition
is
a
reflection
of
its
operational
strategies
.

Investors
have
a
lot
of
different
cards
they
can
play
,
so
they
've
got
to
know
why
your
business
plan
is
worth
pursuing
.

4.
Failure
is
not
rare
or
unusual
.

1.
How
do
you
outline
where
the
company
will
be
in
three
to
five
years
?

The
real
problem
is
that
entrepreneurs
in
Taiwan
do
not
make
clear
enough
definitions
when
trying
to
resolve
a
problem
,
or
they
narrowly
look
at
"
manufacturing
"
as
a
way
of
solving
the
problem
.

Secondly
,
you
should
analyze
why
customers
in
your
market
segment
would
like
to
do
business
with
you
.

If

barriers
are
high

How
do
you
read
financial
clues
?

2.
Forget
about
staying
in
business
forever
.

If
these
businessmen
had
embraced
change
instead
of
resisting
it
,
they
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
move
into
a
new
technological
field
-
rather
than
just
watching
helplessly
as
others
took
over
what
was
once
their
domain
.

With
these
changes
,
legislators
will
exercise
approval
over
personnel
appointments
to
the
Judicial
,
Examination
and
Control
yuans
.

A
China
Times
editorial
urged
that
the
question
of
whether
the
enormous
Legislative
Yuan
might
be
split
into
two
houses
by
function
be
evaluated
and
worked
out
as
soon
as
possible
.

Taiwanese
society
,
caught
up
in
the
furor
over
the
nuclear
power
plant
up
north
,
took
little
immediate
notice
of
the
accident
.

Similarly
,
after
the
recent
spate
of
forest
fires
in
central
and
southern
Taiwan
,
scholars
have
again
reacted
by
calling
on
the
government
to
begin
as
soon
as
possible
with
ongoing
studies
of
Taiwan
's
forest
habitats
.

It
is
a
point
of
view
the
President
sees
and
wants
to
give
.

Well
,
matter
of
fact
,
is
that
if
the
decision
were
left
to
the
ruling
party
in
Lebanon
,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
success
for
the
Arab
initiative
.

It
's
that
we
suffer
from
problems
in
each
state
.

It
is
obvious
to
you
this
issue
has
become
obvious
for
everyone
,
especially
after
some
Arab
countries
entered
the
battlefield
in
Lebanon
in
an
obvious
way
,
and
they
considered
themselves
the
concerned
party
with
that
struggle
and
threat
by
sending
troops
to
Lebanon
to
fight
in
defense
of
that
situation
.

The
problems
%pw
exist
.

The
execution
of
200
meters
of
the
road
has
begun
as
a
prototype
segment
of
the
entire
road
with
the
same
form
.

Yes
.

Perhaps
the
reality
that
Iraq
and
the
region
are
going
through
may
impose
itself
through
the
difficulties
encountered
by
those
who
think
they
are
providing
the
solution
.

These
projects
have
not
been
provided
so
far
.

The
Palestinian
political
powers
have
failed
to
agree
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
crisis
.

I
mean
,
this
ah
ah
represents
an
underlying
bias
in
the
Israeli
judiciary
as
a
whole
for
the
logic
of
rule
of
the
jungle
.

I
believe
the
goal
of
these
operations
is
to
paralyze
life
in
Iraq
,
especially
in
Baghdad
,
the
capital
.

Em
.

Haj
Hussein
Al
-
Khalil
,
Political
Assistant
to
the
Hezbollah
Secretary
General
,
revealed
during
a
special
interview
with
Al
-
Alam
Channel
that
Lebanese
Prime
Minister
Fouad
Siniora
demanded
from
Hezbollah
to
hand
over
its
weapons
,
and
that
was
at
the
time
of
the
last
Israeli
aggression
on
Lebanon
,
or
else
the
Cabinet
would
have
to
issue
its
orders
to
the
security
forces
to
seize
the
party
's
weapons
.

A
representative
in
the
Iraqi
Parliament
and
a
leader
in
the
al
-
Sadr
current
,
Mr.
Salam
.

As
for
the
government
,
it
is
responsible
for
the
security
of
Iraq
as
a
whole
;
so
when
the
Al
-
Sadr
current
announced
its
position
,
it
was
asking
the
government
to
have
the
power
in
controlling
the
security
situation
,
and
it
has
the
bigger
role
in
receiving
the
security
dossier
.

This
is
why
they
came
back
,
and
brought
back
a
lot
of
information
,
which
gave
our
security
services
huge
capabilities
in
hunting
the
terrorists
.

And
here
,
I
have
to
point
out
that
there
is
%pw
there
is
a
fallacy
,
it
seems
that
the
media
people
--

We
have
to
say
something
on
this
issue
.

And
to
the
slip
of
the
tongue
that
was
made
by
Ehud
Olmert
,
in
which
he
admitted
that
the
Israeli
entity
has
nuclear
weapons
.

And
regional
conferences
and
neighboring
states
'
meeting
are
also
held
regularly
,
but
have
stopped
lately
,
and
I
do
n't
think
this
talk
has
any
significance
or
political
implication
.

The
reality
is
that
the
Sykes
-
Picot
case
,
at
that
time
,
when
it
was
set
,
only
paid
attention
to
the
interests
of
the
countries
and
the
outcome
,
ah
,
uh
,
the
balance
of
power
among
them
,
that
is
,
between
France
in
the
first
place
and
,
and
,
and
Britain
or
the
United
Kingdom
.

And
actually
ah
I
mean
,
we
have
been
blessed
with
a
political
leadership
ah
I
mean
insightful
,
ambitious
,
and
on
top
of
it
of
course
the
late
Sheikh
Zayed
Bin
Sultan
Al
Nahyan
,
God
bless
his
soul
.

This
Article
confirms
that
if
the
epidemic
is
spread
to
one
person
,
the
sentence
will
be
life
in
prison
,
but
if
the
epidemic
was
spread
to
more
than
one
person
,
the
sentence
is
the
death
penalty

Yes
.

Uh
,
the
latest
information
that
we
received
so
far
is
that
these
battles
between
the
two
sides
,
uh
,
started
after
the
Friday
prayers
%pw
and
these
,
and
they
started
exactly
in
a
place
known
,
a
small
village
called
%pw
Safar
Nooley
,
said
to
be
80
kilometers
away
from
Dinsor
in
the
direction
of
Baidoa
.

Uh-huh
.

And
the
advent
of
the
Hamas
Movement
came
to
add
complexity
%pw
to
things
because
effectively
,
it
did
not
recognize
the
framework
through
which
it
came
to
power
.

They
have
many
goals
ah
for
such
a
project
,
the
most
important
of
which
is
to
build
one
hundred
new
settlements
they
have
been
planning
to
establish
in
the
Negev
.

In
January
of
that
year
,
the
Hong
Kong
government
turned
over
to
Disney
Corporation
200
hectares
of
land
at
the
foot
of
Lantau
Island
that
was
obtained
following
the
largest
land
reclamation
project
in
recent
years
.

Since
the
implementation
of
the
Individual
Visit
Scheme
between
Hong
Kong
and
the
mainland
,
more
and
more
mainland
tourists
are
coming
to
visit
Hong
Kong
.

To
improve
the
park
's
brand
,
they
are
planning
to
invest
5.5
billion
in
a
renovation
project
starting
in
2006
.

She
is
my
Goddess
,
ah
.

Whenever
there
is
a
major
event
or
holiday
,
fireworks
are
also
added
to
the
light
show
.

Then
,
the
bridge
is
,
on
the
bridge
is
Hong
Kong
and
outside
is
Shenzhen
.

Among
common
birds
,
a
rather
special
one
is
the
black
-
faced
spoonbill
.

We
hope
to
use
,
er
,
a
variety
of
hardware
and
software
to
package
this
entire
2006
Discover

One
has
to
go
up
to
Shenzhen
,
Dongguan
,
then
go
through
Panyu
,
keep
going
up
,
to
Zhongshan
,
and
certainly
go
to

then
pass
through
Zhuhai
to
get
to

.

Ah
,
different
,
ah
,
some
groups
,
they
are
rehearsing
their
service
,
well
,
hoping
that
they
will
become
used
to
the
service
,
be
familiar
with
it
,
when
our
tourists
come
in
September
.

More
than
three
hundred
Taiwanese
businesspeople
gathered
in
this
land
known
as
"
lush
southern
-
type
fields
north
of
the
Great
Wall
,
"
beginning
their
tour
and
inspection
journey
.

It
was
during
this
year
that
the
Japanese
army
developed
a
strategy
to
rapidly
force
the
Chinese
people
into
submission
by
the
end
of
1940
.

In
addition
,
it
relied
on
this
cage
,
ah
,
to
further
strengthen
its
assaults
against
the
base
areas
.

On
that
dark
night
,
everyone
was
sleeping
when
human
voices
and
neighing
horses
were
heard
within
the
village
.

Led
by
Nie
Rongzhen
,
the
Shanxi
-
Chahar
-
Hebei
Military
District
was
ready
for
an
offensive
,
while
at
the
same
time
,
fifteen
regiments
laid
an
ambush
in
advance
along
the
Zhengtai
Railway
,
launching
fierce
attacks
on
Japanese
military
strongholds
along
the
railway
line
.

The
Hundred
Regiments
Offensive
dealt
a
devastating
blow
to
the
enemy
at
Shi'nao
Mountain
.

They
were
poisoned
and
did
not
know
how
to
protect
themselves
against
the
poison
.

We
people
,
ah
,
were
under
his
command
for
the
time
being
.

It
was
a
very
tough
battle
.

Hey
,
this
was
my
life
.

Only
our
great
General
Peng
.

On
June
30
,
1987
,
the
Monument
to
the
Hundred
Regiments
Offensive
was
erected
on
Shi'nao
Mountain
in
Yangquan
,
Shanxi
,
where
the
heroes
had
fought
the
battle
.

On
August
17
,
Taiwan
's
investigation
department
and
police
solved
the
case
and
announced
the
%pw
March
19
shooting
case
was
closed
.

What
kind
of
situation
will
Japan
find
itself
in
at
the
APEC
summit
?

That
is
,
through
multilateral
meetings
,
he
attempted
to
meet
with
,
ah
,
leaders
of
South
Korea
or
other
Asian
nations
,
Uh-huh
.
so
as
to
--
Uh-huh
.
demonstrate
that
even
though
he
visited
Yasukuni
Shrine
,
Uh-huh
.
his
relations
with
neighboring
countries
are
not
affected
.

Well
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
is
,
it
was
to
express
that
there
shall
be
no
more
war
in
future
.

Well
,
was
n't
it
that
things
went
contrary
to
his
wishes
?

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

We
know
that
in
1957
Japan
had
three
diplomatic
principles
.

Right
,
his
idea
was
actually
criticized
and
opposed
by
some
politicians
even
in
Japan
.

Uh-huh
.

They
both
showed
that
due
to
the
cooling
down
of
the
political
relationship
,
well
,
the
economic
relations
between
China
and
Japan
have
already
been
severely
affected
.

Well
,
with
regard
to
Koizumi
's
diplomatic
thinking
,
there
is
still
one
point
,
that
is
,
one
question
.

We
can
also
say
that
some
think
tank
people
around
him
may
have
given
him
the
wrong
idea
.

South
Korea
thinks
that
this
island
called
Dokdo
Island
has
always
been
a
Korean
territory
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

Japan
placed
its
hope
of
becoming
a
permanent
member
of
the
Security
Council
this
year
.

Uh-huh
.

It
has
triggered
that
--

He
has
started
to
get
ready
.

Toshihiro
Nikai
.

Well
,
mainly
we
will
see
whether
he
gives
priority
to
diplomacy
or
internal
affairs
and
whether
he
is
more
a
hawk
or
a
dove
.

For
instance
,
China
's
economy
is
growing
,
eh
,
and
getting
stronger
,
but
we
see
the
relations
between
China
and
South
Korea
are
indeed
developing
rapidly
.

I
do
n't
think
it
is
certain
at
this
point
that
he
will
change
suddenly
and
completely
.

Good-bye
.

Nanjing
,
overcast
,
8
to
13
degrees
.

Heading
a
Russian
business
delegation
of
more
than
one
hundred
people
this
time
,
Putin
wants
to
improve
bilateral
relations
through
promoting
economic
development
.

Uh-huh
.

Okay
,
thank
you
very
much
,
Professor
Wang
,
for
briefing
us
on
the
relevant
information
in
Japan
.

What
method
does
he
want
to
use
to
remedy
the
lethargic
<ENAMEX
TYPE="ORG"
S_OFF="5">post-APEC
diplomatic
situation
?

Uh-huh
.

That
is
to
say
,
both
sides
have
strong
nationalist
sentiments
domestically
and
powerful
parliaments
.

Uh-huh
.

It
has
such
a
vision
.

In
various
versions
,
some
said
Putin
would
visit
Japan
in
April
2005
,
some
said
May
,
while
others
said
June
.

In
the
past
,
only
the
issue
of
two
islands
was
recognized
.

I
think
the
time
of
Russia
's
most
urgent
need
is
already
over
.

Uh-huh
.

This
is
a
very
small
figure
in
terms
of
trade
relations
between
two
countries
.

So
one
very
important
aim
of
Putin
's
visit
this
time
,
which
I
also
think
is
very
clever
,
is
to
put
aside
some
very
sensitive
old
territorial
topics
.

Well
,
now
it
seems
that
Koizumi
has
still
not
changed
this
course
.

Uh-huh
.

In
1955
the
Soviet
Union
and
Japan
began
negotiations
regarding
the
normalization
of
relations
.

With
quite
a
troubled
economy
,
quite
a
troubled
economy
,
Russia
needed
Japanese
investment
,
needed
Japan
to
get
involved
through
this
channel
.

Uh-huh
.

This
is
a
new
incarnation
,
but
with
different
political
significance
.

That
is
,
it
will
be
a
normal
,
that
is
,
very
common
,
very
,
relatively
bland
kind
of
relationship
.

Uh-huh
.

Was
this
a
joke
told
by
US
President
Bush
or
was
it
a
long
-
meditated
threat
?

We
will
first
talk
about
the
Daily
Mirror
article
that
started
it
.

Let
's
start
with
this
newspaper
.

Well
,
this
newspaper
is
said
to
have
various
kinds
of
topics
appropriate
to
all
ages
.

However
,
there
is
still
one
detail
.

Well
,
of
course
it
is
still
in
a
preliminary
stage
right
now
,
and
yesterday
a
hearing
lasting
only
15
minutes
was
held
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

Since
the
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
logo
is
on
,
people
should
be
quite
familiar
with
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
.

What
did
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
look
like
when
it
just
started
broadcasting
?

Right
.

Though
it
is
funded
by
the
government
with
many
of
its
properties
owned
by
the
government
,
it
still
follows
the
guideline
of
editorial
independence
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

So
,
the
reason
why
it
is
successful
,
to
put
it
simply
,
I
think
,
is
that
it
mainly
relies
on
its
own
very
professional
news
team
.

Yes
.

Do
you
still
remember
,
ah
,
during
the
Afghan
war
and
the
Iraq
war
,
we
could
often
see
on
screen
the
al
-
Jazeera
footage
such
as
bin
Laden
and
some
other
al
-
Qaeda
leaders
giving
speeches
.

Uh-huh
.

Er
,
this
point
must
be
acknowledged
.

Well
,
the
facts
may
not
conform
to
the
interests
of
Mr.
Bush
.

Yeah
.

It
will
stay
as
a
topic
of
public
commentaries
,
because
this
involves
--
if
the
US
indeed
had
such
a
plan
,
then
its
so
-
called
%pw
,
the
freedom
of
speech
it
advocates
will
be
again
greatly
discounted
.

Uh-huh
.

In
addition
,
in
the
following
days
,
it
will
bring
a
new
round
of
temperature
drops
in
the
most
part
of
the
country
.

Vienna
,
cloudy
,
1
degree
below
zero
to
2
degrees
.

In
addition
,
what
measures
did
relevant
departments
take
to
resolve
issues
such
as
waste
discharge
,
heating
,
and
communication
,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
lives
of
citizens
were
not
affected
?

Uh-huh
,
that
means
,
er
,
you
found
out
the
accident
through
an
information
source
at
the
station
.

Yes
.

In
particular
,
%pw
more
terminals
,
such
as
this
,
this
cable
television
,
ah
,
this
,
this
digital
television
,
ah
,
and
mobile
phone
SMS
,
are
applied
in
e-government
.

Yes
.

Colleagues
and
friends
also
informed
one
another
by
phone
calls
and
SMS
.

That
is
,
if
we
have
an
ordinary
fender
bender
or
tailgate
accident
on
a
bridge
such
as
the
Jingguang
Bridge
of
the
Third
Ring
Road
,
it
might
cause
the
entire
Third
Ring
Road
to
have
bumper
-
to
-
bumper
traffic
jams
during
these
morning
and
evening
peak
periods
.

For
instance
,
this
evening
,
we
had
a
,
received
an
SMS
.

Uh-huh
.

Ah
,
today
is
the
first
workday
after
the
New
Year
holiday
.

Well
,
in
this
respect
,
we
citizens
should
also
contribute
our
efforts
.

Yang
Yang
,
do
you
know
how
many
pipes
there
are
underground
?

How
can
cooperation
be
formed
between
departments
in
this
kind
of
situation
?

Uh-huh
.

Well
,
Beijing
Traffic
Radio
Station
is
to
be
activated
as
a
media
for
emergency
plans
that
are
grade
three
and
above
.

Yes
,
this
kind
of
early
warning
and
forecast
mechanism
.

With
a
background
of
liberalization
,
marketization
,
and
privatization
,
how
can
the
government
strengthen
supervision
of
public
utilities
industries
?

Traffic
,
ah
,
can
be
said
to
have
been
directed
,
and
is
basically
under
control
now
.

Um
,
and
,
for
instance
,
optical
fibers
,
ah
.

Let
's
turn
our
attention
to
the
weather
.

Dalian
,
sunny
,
11
degrees
below
zero
to
5
degrees
below
zero
.

Do
you
have
to
shave
it
every
day
?

Although
by
that
time
his
grandfather
Ye
Ting
had
been
dead
for
12
years
,
the
Ye
family
maintained
its
status
as
a
highly
esteemed
Communist
household
.

From
that
time
on
he
often
did
things
that
went
beyond
the
norm
,
sometimes
to
protect
himself
and
sometimes
to
take
care
of
his
family
.

Right
.

Finally
a
very
big
rock
,
a
lump
of
earth
,
hit
me
on
the
head
,
and
And
I
got
angry
,
so
angry
that
I
rushed
out
with
a
shovel
and
hit
them
with
the
shovel
.

Mm
.

I
say
you
take
a
whack
.

This
is
obviously
him
as
a
boy
,
uh
,
a
memory
of
his
childhood
life
.

But
they
,
those
adults
standing
around
reasoned
with
me
,
said
look
,
you
do
n't
understand
this
.

Mm
,
well
.

What
kind
of
people
were
in
your
class
?

Um
,
of
course
today
we
say
,
at
that
time
,
um
,
in
that
class
of
ours
,
they
were
n't
all
necessarily
bad
kids
.

You
just
want
to
go
see
the
movie
,
you
do
n't
worry
about
holding
hands
or
not
,
um
,
and
that
was
great
,
the
,
the
,
the
--

How
was
it
she
liked
you
?

The
--

However
,
at
this
time
Ye
Daying
,
facing
this
opportunity
that
would
change
his
fortune
,
was
at
a
loss
as
to
what
to
do
.

It
was
very
,
the
extraordinary
thing
was
,
at
that
time
my
mom
was
attending
the
film
institute
,
she
was
an
instructor
there
.

The
next
year
,
21
-
year
-
old
Ye
Daying
passed
the
entrance
exam
for
the
actors
training
class
at
the
Xi'an
Film
Studio
.

That
projecting
force
of
his
,
I
thought
wow
,
this
,
that
's
really
good
.

So
I
had
never
served
as
a
soldier
,
that
kind
of
pose
,
it
was
really
awful
.

It
's
named
after
a
foreigner
.

Later
,
based
on
that
,
it
all
evaporated
.

Um
,
in
the
end
I
knew
we
--

Will
peasant
associations
become
a
direction
of
organized
rural
development
?

The
first
time
,
organizing
the
first
time
,
I
,
at
the
time
that
Zhaizi
Technical
Center
was
seven
or
eight
li
from
our
village
,
and
it
was
on
the
banks
of
the
Yellow
River
!

Since
December
of
'98
,
each
year
we
've
held
four
to
six
training
sessions
.

If
nobody
wanted
to
pay
it
back
,
I
would
gradually
pay
it
off
.

So
as
of
right
now
,
I
still
have
65,000
yuan
to
pay
.

So
then
,
I
was
thinking
,
could
n't
the
peasants
join
up
with
us
in
this
fertilizer
store
by
becoming
shareholders
?

Because
there
,
leaders
of
different
sectors
from
our
city
,
they
all
came
here
to
us
.

And
a
thing
that
came
next
made
the
villagers
not
only
see
that
Zheng
Bing
had
a
spirit
of
sacrifice
,
but
her
organizing
skills
also
could
instill
confidence
in
people
.

After
a
series
of
women
's
activities
,
the
spirit
of
villagers
in
Zhaizi
Village
had
changed
.

Because
,
first
of
all
,
these
lanes
are
a
matter
of
concern
to
all
of
us
.

In
the
shareholding
issue
,
Zheng
Bing
and
the
association
members
ran
into
a
succession
of
problems
.

Zheng
Bing
proposed
giving
one
share
to
these
households
,
with
the
capital
coming
from
the
association
's
expenditures
.

They
also
let
members
buy
on
credit
and
pay
it
off
at
harvest
time
.

This
is
absolutely
contrary
to
the
facts
.

Who
else
was
in
attendance
at
the
time
?

In
fact
,
on
August
20
,
1976
,
the
Hebei
Science
Committee
had
issued
a
brief
report
which
for
the
first
time
revealed
the
facts
about
Qinglong
having
successfully
prepared
against
the
Great
Tangshan
Earthquake
.

He
wanted
to
make
a
pre-quake
speech
,
and
he
would
n't
allow
it
.

Uh
,
the
wolf
came
,
and
whose
child
did
he
carry
off
?

Maybe
you
do
n't
acknowledge
the
debt
,
but
you
'd
feel
bad
about
it
.

Before
the
Great
Tangshan
Earthquake
,
the
Kailuan
Mine
Bureau
did
a
lot
of
work
to
establish
feasible
measures
to
ensure
that
underground
miners
safely
escape
dangers
.

At
the
time
,
about
half
the
Kailuan
miners
were
stuck
underground
.

Why
?

When
you
did
your
investigation
,
and
you
discovered
that
at
the
time
China
's
level
was
such
as
to
be
able
to
predict
this
earthquake
,
what
did
you
think
?

Life
is
more
important
than
anything
else
!

The
price
paid
for
the
Great
Tangshan
Earthquake
was
240,000
lives
tragically
lost
,
and
that
will
forever
be
part
of
history
;

These
are
called
left
-
behind
children
.

This
group
should
be
the
biggest
in
number
.

Of
course
,
there
are
many
impacts
in
other
aspects
,
for
instance
,
peer
socialization
.

I
want
to
go
home
.
"

They
,
they
raised
this
point
themselves
.

He
said
that
he
was
sick
one
time
.

Um
,
there
was
also
this
child
.

Most
of
the
children
's
parents
are
in
the
southern
part
of
the
country
.

He
was
only
eight
years
old
at
that
time
.

I
think
it
is
hard
to
say
anything
meaningful
in
three
minutes
.

The
children
have
a
great
need
for
this
type
of
telephone
exchange
.

What
work
are
you
going
to
do
today
,
other
than
cooking
?

We
also
asked
them
why
they
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
city
.

They
have
to
find
a
place
to
live
.

However
,
one
time
we
visited
him
,
his
um
,
family
told
us
that
he
was
second
in
his
class
in
his
examination
.

Will
they
think
that
love
is
important
in
society
or
not
,
because
they
have
never
experienced
it
.

These
two
children
were
looking
after
the
home
.

So
many
people
shocked
and
absolutely
stunned
by
what
happened
/.

Uh
going
to
be
c-
--
it
's
going
to
be
a
long
night
and
a
long
couple
of
days
as
we
're
trying
to
piece
together
uh
the
the
information
exactly
what
occured
in
those
terrible
moments
before
the
shooting
/.

I
should
just
point
out
to
to
our
viewers
we
're
not
using
the
young
man
's
name
/.

Uh
w-
was
he
that
type
/?

Most
often
the
perpetrator
is
a
white
male
age
eleven
to
eighteen
who
was
described
as
feeling
picked
on
or
bullied
by
his
peers
/.

Still
ahead
tonight
more
late
election
returns
more
races
that
could
affect
you
more
questions
about
how
this
affects
the
president
and
his
party
/.

so
that
a
frustrating
race
for
the
democrats
/.

Virginia
was
one
of
the
first
southern
states
to
to
go
republican
/.

A
case
that
may
be
heading
where
Terri
Schiavo
's
did
/.

Talk
about
a
little
bit
uh
of
love
to
share
around
the
family
there
/.

Uh
this
is
what
we
know
about
his
case
/.

No
/.

I
believe
in
in
a
living
God
/.

and
that
will
once
again
put
him
at
odds
with
Terri
's
parents
whose
still
untitled
memoir
will
be
released
that
same
month
/.

What
will
happen
to
the
wildlife
/?

An
estimated
eleven
feet
tall
,
weighing
perhaps
fourteen
thousand
pounds
the
mature
bull
elephant
was
as
big
and
angry
as
any
they'd
'd
seen
before
/.

That
's
all
I
can
tell
you
/.

and
that
was
n't
all
he
saw
/.

they
approach
you
/.

And
the
neat
thing
about
it
is
there
will
be
a
web
camera
up
there
/.

Oh
gosh
/.

No
they
do
n't
want
those
divisions
/.

Uganda
has
about
another
three
hundred
/.

Uh
also
why
some
are
calling
the
riots
in
France
that
country
's
Katrina
problems
long
in
the
making
that
the
violence
has
now
revealed
/.

We
're
taking
your
calls
/.

CNN
's
David
Mattingly
joins
us
with
the
latest
on
the
investigation
/.

Uh
authorities
will
not
talk
about
that
tonight
/.

Never
was
a
debate
about
this
subject
before
/.

If
I
torture
you
you
're
going
to
tell
me
exactly
what
I
expect
to
hear
/.

So
what
exactly
does
that
mean
/?

What
do
you
think
about
Professor
Dershowitz
's
argument
tha-
that
torture
in
under
any
circumstances
is
wrong
uh
a-
and
that
th-
he
supports
the
McCain
amendment
uh
but
if
the
preside-
--
at
the
president
's
direction
uh
under
extraordinary
circumstances
/.

stop
the
f-
--
stop
throwing
around
words
like
that
/.

Always
/.

He
says
that
the
b-
uh
basic
--
and
I
'm
paraphrasing
that
basically
the
the
element
of
surprise
what
the
enemy
does
not
know
about
what
we
're
going
to
do
to
them
is
a
very
powerful
tool
/.

Anderson
more
statements
from
the
democrats
celebrating
tonight
more
events

by
the
democrats
tomorrow
/.

A
split
verdict
if
you
will
on
the
issue
of
gay
rights
/.

Do
you
use
medication
too
/?

Oh
/.

I
mean
I
've
come
through
a
lot
of
things
/.

I
lived
off
campus
/.

When
you
hit
it
big
with
Terminator
and
everything
was
going
fantastic
for
you
you
were
still
bipolar
,
right
/?

How
old
are
the
children
/?

We
'll
be
right
back
/.

but
I
know
people
that
have
/.

Did
n't
notice
it
/.

I
did
not
know
/.

Want
more
information
/.

Did
you
get
so
low
that
/-

He
had
given
me
some
medicine
to
have
in
my
drawer
if
I
ever
decided
I
wanted
to
go
that
route
/.

Uh
bipolar
disorder
is
characterized
by
mood
swings
severe
mood
swings
/.

There
's
a
big
gap
that
needs
to
be
bridged
/.

Um
but
certain
for
me
yes
/.

Nope
/.

I
'm
um
just
getting
ready
to
do
a
character
arc
in
a
new
show
for
FX
called
Beef
/.

First
of
all
Linda
you
look
phenomenal
/.

It
's
hard
though
to
be
close
to
someone
who
is
screaming
at
you
/.

And
I
've
got
such
a
fantastic
fantastic
husband
/.

Yes
/.

Oh
ah
right
/.

and
I
do
n't
want
to
get
off
the
topic
/.

I
had
training
in
mental
health
and
also
worked
in
drugs
and
alcohol
in
a
women
's
prison
and
found
that
there
are
so
many
women
in
prison
who
have
that
same
problem
and
in
terms
of
bipolar
and
were
self
medicating
and
they
're
in
prison
for
a
great
amount
of
time
and
when
they
are
released
then
they
go
off
the
medication
if
they
are
on
it
/.

but
you
know
I
/.

Uh
um
uh
I
'm
sixty
years
old
/.

I
mean
that
's
one
of
the
things
that
I
hear
all
the
time
Oh
I
do
n't
believe
in
depression
you
know
/.

I
'm
going
to
make
this
as
succinct
as
possible
/.

But
uh
they
can
find
the
University
of
Medicine
and
Dentistry
in
New
Jersey
/.

mhm
mhm
/.

Um
and
that
's
really
between
you
and
your
doctor
to
try
to
find
your
way
through
um
those
side
effects
/.

Thank
you
Linda
/.

and
the
question
would
be
why
do
n't
they
both
wait
until
the
hearing
/?

No
not
at
all
just
as
Sam
said
/.

You
can
tell
by
the
way
both
sides
are
lining
up
--
the
activists
on
both
sides
are
lining
up
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
Donnybrook
/.

Speaking
of
that
Senator
Schumer
did
you
prefer
--
did
you
want
a
woman
/?

Judge
Alito
is
fifty
-
five
years

Roe

Wade
the
right
to
an
abortion
that
's
read
into
the

is
not
in
the
constitution

Sam
may
have
been
on
the
edge
/.

Thank
you
senators
Brownback
and
Schumer
and
David
Gergen
/.

There
you
see
its
cover
/.

You
know
something
/?

No
/.

you
're
the
guest
OK
/?

I
did
n't
hear
the
DVD
yet
though
/.

and
what
a
vicious
unpleasant
lying
etc
etc
etc
/.

The
people
at
the
uh
publisher
heard
about
it
saw
it
and
said
Hey
somebody
's
got
a
hell
of
a
book
/.

She
's
such
a
special
lady
/.

Well
she
's
an
adorable
woman
/.

Great
moment
in
the
book
/.

had
it
on
the
air
/.

I
mean
I
've
talked
to
every
President
since
Abe
Lincoln
so
and
every
first
lady
since
Martha
Washington
/.

Indeed
I
was
/.

and
here
is
Mr.
Wallace
with
Mr.
Nixon
/.

but
I
find
it
uh
not
only
bizarre
but
uh
just
unfathomable
how
George
Bush
has
been
silent
about
Karl
Rove
/.

You
know
something
/?

Thank
you
so
much
/.

Yeah
/.

Turned
down
an
interview
/?

But
you
were
married
,
right
/?

It
was
um
just
after
the
hostages
the
US
hostages
had
been
taken
in
Iran
/.

And
he
has
succeeded
/.

/.

That
was
the
--
that
was
the
role
I
played
sure
/.

As
usual
Larry
thanks
so
much
/.

Was
Sixty
Minutes
unfair
to
Bill
Clinton
in
airing
Louis
Freeh
's
charges
against
him
/?

that
never
happened
/.

In
other
words
there
's
a
dispute
in
the
accounts
/.

and
I
think
the
agreement
was
strange
/.

And
the
question
and
this
is
a
very
serious
question
it
's
not
answered
in
the
article
/.

This
was
a
very
difficult
decision
/.

Well
just
to
clarify
uh
she
did
ultimately
uh
testify
about
her
confidential
source
/.

All
these
things
are
there
in
black
and
white
/.

and
it
's
about
thr-
you
know
being
ending
up
in
j-
--
in
jail
or
in
court
/.

But
uh
will
it
bring
down
the
administration
/?

It
's
very
easy
to
sit
here
and
say
oh
we
should
never
speculate
in
journalism
/.

Yeah
you
know
something
/?

Yes
it
is
shocking
/.

Let
's
deal
with
the
substance
first
/.

You
were
n't
there
/.

That
's
disparaging
/.

so
what
Mister
Freeh
said
was
false
/.

Ahead
in
the
second
half
of
Reliable
Sources
New
York
Times
columnist
Tom
Friedman
on
whether
the
media
are
suffering
from
Iraq
fatigue
/.

Those
are
the
headlines
this
morning
/.

I
'm
a
firm
believer
/.

There
is
Iraq
fatigue
/.

And
it
's
part
of
the
general
continuing
insecurity
of
Iraq
that
um
I
'm
afraid
has
plagued
this
story
from
the
very
beginning
/.

I
'm
so
interested
in
it
/.

It
's
here
/.

Not
at
odds
though
with
what
actually
the
military
commanders
have
been
saying
which
is
that
the
number
of
really
trained
Iraqi
units
you
know
are
far
fewer
than
than
sometimes
suggested
by
the
administration
/.

Absolutely
because
I
believe
this
is
important
/.

to
hear
ten
thousand
twenty
thousand
forty
thousand
then
it
's
almost
hard
for
a
journalist
to
process
/.

That
a
reasonable
observation
/?

I
would
call
it
a
poli-
--
a
perfect
storm
/.

My
wife
Andrea
edits
them
all
/.

I
mean
I
'm
going
to
China
on
on
uh
on
Monday
/.

The
threat
to
attack
the
subways
in
coming
days
comes
from
overseas
/.

Reporters
are
tired
of
the
usual
standups
you
know
Howard
Kurtz
Oshkosh
Wisconsin
/.

It
's
noon
in
Washington
nine
am
in
Los
Angelas
seven
pm
in
Bayreuth
and
eight
pm
in
Baghdad
/.

Now
back
to
Wolf
/.

We
have
the
right
number
of
troops
in
Iraq
/.

The
insurgents
ca
n't
win
/.

Give
us
your
assessment
/.

When
politics
move
in
different
directions
the
numbers
go
up
/.

They
there
is
a
growing
capability
of
the
Iraqi
security
forces
to
be
more
and
more
effective
against
the
insurgency
/.

Most
army
units
can
not
operate
above
platoon
size
/.

I
would
say
that
US
officials
and
Iraqi
officials
are
looking
for
the
right
people
in
the
Sunni
community
to
talk
to
in
order
to
insure
that
the
Sunni
Arab
community
becomes
part
of
the
political
process
/.

It
's
connected
to
Al
-
Queda
/.

Is
it
time
to
reconsider
women
American
women
in
combat
in
the
aftermath
of
what
happened
this
past
week
/?

We
we
do
n't
need
to
fight
this
war
looking
over
our
shoulder
worrying
about
support
back
home
/.

We
need
to
have
them
working
towards
stability
in
both
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
/.

The
US
has
criticized
Iran
's
recent
election
as
a
sham
/.

Uh
I
hope
it
's
realistic
/.

He
said
it
was
the
last
throes
of
the
insurgency
/.

And
I
hope
the
President
will
insist
on
Tuesday
night
that
the
Iraqis
live
up
to
that
timetable
because
if
that
political
process
does
not
move
along
on
that
timetable
the
military
solution
can
not
solve
this
problem
/.

They
can
work
with
us
and
be
with
us
/.

and
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
the
the
the
critics
are
determined
that
this
time
it
's
not
going
to
be
like
Vietnam
,
this
time
as
long
as
our
men
and
women
are
there
everything
we
possibly
can
do
to
support
them
is
going
to
be
done
including
realistic
thinking
and
constructive
criticism
/.

Late
Edition
will
be
right
back
/.

Many
see
the
hand
of
the
Syrian
government
behind
these
assassinations
/.

And
that
was
when
uh
eh
uh
they
tried
to
put
a
bomb
in
the
uh
Italian
embassy
/.

As
you
know
we
have
still
troubles
in
the
south
/.

He
was
referring
to
the
possibility
that
Syrian
intelligence
agents
are
still
operating
inside
Lebanon
even
though
the
Syrian
military
has
withdrawn
/.

And
this
is
a
very
grave
problem
for
Lebanon
/.

We
'll
take
a
quick
break
/.

They
are
being
held
in
Suffix
/.

Well
can
you
confirm
that
you
will
seek
a
thirty
day
extension
beyond
August
fifteenth
/?

Will
Islam
be
the
official
religion
of
the
state
and
the
source
of
all
law
in
Iraq
/?

but
also
it
's
the
maintain
and
security
or
securing
the
rights
of
the
minority
as
well
/.

You
can
not
--
there
are
so
many
factors
who
who
's
--
who
are
playing
in
this
process
/.

it
said
this
/.

When
will
the
trial
the
real
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
finally
begin
/?

I
think
we
'll
leave
the
judicial
system
to
its
own
devices
so
that
they
will
take
their
own
time
and
they
will
uh
sentence
Saddam
/.

We
'll
ask
two
key
United
States
senators
about
that
and
more
/.

He
's
the
ranking
member
of
the
Homeland
Security
and
Governmental
Affairs
Committees
/.

and
and
for
one
reason
it
would
give
greater
pressure
or
put
added
pressure
really
on
the
Iraqi
military
really
to
take
charge
/.

All
right
let
's
move
on
/.

We
've
broken
up
cells
/.

Senator
Collins
Susan
Collins
and
I
are
going
to
do
hearings
on
that
in
the
fall
/.

The
argument
is
that
law
enforcement
authorities
transportation
security
authorities
they
're
spinning
a
lot
of
wheels
wasting
a
lot
of
time
examining
grandmothers
and
babies
and
making
people
take
off
their
shoes
when
they
should
be
focusing
in
on
real
threats
as
opposed
to
potential
random
threats
out
there
/.

Hello
I
'm
Frederika
Whitfield
in
at
the
CNN
center
in
Atlanta
/.

Uh
it
would
have
been
a
lot
better
idea
for
the
administration
to
give
the
senators
on
the
Foreign
Relations
Committee
the
information
they
said
they
needed
and
I
think
they
were
right
uh
before
uh
they
could
vote
on
the
uh
Bolton
nomination
/.

we
got
together
to
stop
the
so
called
nuclear
option
that
Senator
Frist
was
talking
about
/.

Uh
in
this
particular
case
I
agree
with
his
previous
position
and
that
of
the
President
/.

An-
and
it
's
really
the
right
thing
to
do
/.

thanks
very
much
for
joining
us
/.

but
we
think
the
probability
is
remote
/.

Uh
we
did
not
see
anything
of
significance
/.

We
have
uh
environmentally
controlled
areas
where
we
do
all
our
work
/.

Thank
you
very
much
Wolf
/.

Uh
eighteen
months
into
Watergate
we
knew
about
the
tapes
/.

or
was
the
climate
toward
the
press
so
much
different
then
/?

what
does
this
look
like
/.

and
I
think
the
judge
in
the
case
should
've
been
much
more
rigorous
in
making
the
government
really
show
they
have
evidence
of
a
crime
and
they
need
this
testimony
/.

Scott
I
mean
just
I
mean
this
is
ridiculous
the
notion
that
you
're
going
to
stand
before
us
after
having
commented
with
that
level
of
detail
and
tell
people
watching
this
that
somehow
you
've
decided
not
to
talk
/.

we
're
in
the
dragging
out
phase
/.

Let
's
take
a
look
at
how
most
people
think
of
--
who
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
of
Deep
Throat
/.

Yes
o-
i-
it
's
very
d-
duplicitous
yes
/.

there
's
no
question
about
it
/.

We
'll
ask
Bob
Woodward
that
question
next
/.

he
's
happy
/.

what
more
is
there
to
it
/.

and
he
said
you
really
ca
n't
get
informed
consent
/.

but
I
thought
ah
Rehnquist
said
it
best
when
somebody
asked
him
recently
and
said
it
's
for
me
to
know
and
you
to
find
out
/.

Um
should
they
give
more
interviews
to
people
like
you
/?

Is
that
a
replacement
/?

First
of
all
here
's
a
quick
track
of
some
of
the
stories
we
're
following
tonight
/.

Two
weeks
ago
climbers
discovered
a
frozen
man
face
down
in
the
snow
still
in
his
army
air
force
uniform
and
an
unopened
silk
parachute
/.

they
're
sealed
up
which
is
more
indicative
of
someone
who
would
be
at
least
twenty
-
one
years
old
/.

Well
hi
Paula
/.

What
we
want
to
do
is
have
the
evidence
speak
for
itself
/.

Hi
Paula
/.

Yeah
Erica
I
actually
um
bumped
into
them
along
with
three
hundred
of
their
closest
friends
earlier
tonight
on
th-
their
last
stop
of
the
day
here
in
New
York
/.

She
was
a
very
good
mother
/.

They
all
died
in
the
flood
/.

uh
and
the
state
does
n't
really
do
very
much
about
it
/.

I
mean
I
went
to
bed
with
nothing
in
my
stomach
either
/.

and
this
is
what
they
call
a
heaving
/.

Here
are
the
results
of
the
CNN
USA
Today
Gallup
poll
released
just
minutes
ago
of
those
asked
about
the
president
's
choice
Judge
Alito
to
succeed
Justice
Sandra
Day
O'Connor
/.

and
this
is
a
pure
stunt
/.

You
've
been
hearing
an
awful
lot
about
avian
or
bird
flu
/.

The
other
thing
Paula
really
important
is
that
they
talk
a
lot
about
the
fact
that
our-
we
're
a
lot
better
at
taking
care
of
patients
now
than
we
were
in
nineteen
eighteen
,
we
have
a
lot
of
ICUs
a
lot
of
ICUs
in
the
hospital
behind
me
that
can
take
care
of
critically
ill
patients
/.

I
can
assure
you
that
Paula
/.

but
its
marketing
has
already
enraged
people
in
South
Central
Los
Angeles
/.

Back
in
LA
the
image
hits
too
close
to
home
/.

I
mean
they
I
mean
usually
in
this
area
nobody
really
cares
/.

listen
up
please
/.

They
worked
--
they
did
n't
do
too
much
work
yesterday
/.

Queen
Elizabeth
and
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
attended
as
did
relatives
to
those
who
died
and
emergency
workers
who
responded
to
the
terrorist
attacks
/.

I
'll
remember
it
forever
I
think
/.

Andrew
Carey
CNN
London
/.

I
'm
looking
for
the
apprentice
/.

Anybody
can
be
saved
/.

We
're
all
welcoming
the
prince
and
the
duchess
or
mistress
of
whatever
she
is
this
week
/.

They
then
unveiled
a
memorial
to
British
victims
of
Nine
Eleven
/.

And
I
'm
Rick
Sanchez
/.

Its
corporate
policies
from
buying
cheap
to
selling
cheap
to
providing
jobs
for
tens
of
thousands
of
people
while
paying
rock
bottom
salaries
are
also
reasons
it
's
a
big
target
/.

But
uh
Wal
-
Mart
has
closed
some
businesses
down
/.

How
much
does
Wal
-
Mart
depend
on
China
/?

Workplace
health
plans
can
be
should
be
and
may
be
going
away
/.

What
business
is
it
of
yours
how
they
do
their
business
/?

Good
to
see
you
/.

and
they
are
really
starting
to
fight
back
/.

A
lot
of
people
like
working
there
/.

but
I
think
you
're
right
/.

Now
he
's
on
death
row
/.

The
afternoon
and
evening
demonstrations
organized
by
the
group
The
World
Ca
n't
Wait
led
police
to
close
many
streets
around
a
federal
building
in
West
LA
/.

Here
it
's
about
progress
and
optimism
/.

We
isolated
from
the
whole
city
/.

This
room
was
an
addition
to
the
house
/.

So
uh
a-
as
devastating
as
it
is
you
're
really
kind
of
fortunate
because
once
you
take
out
the
plaster
,
once
you
take
out
the
insulation
make
sure
that
the
inside
of
the
building
is
dry
uh
the
foundation
is
dry
you
can
really
start
the
rebuilding
process
/.

Yeah
/?

Would
you
believe
that
some
liberal
Democrats
might
support
President
Bush
's
Supreme
Court
Nominee
Samuel
Alito
/?

No
no
no
/.

From
around
the
world
this
is
Newsnight
/.

It
's
not
against
the
law
to
be
a
gang
member
/.

But
he
did
n't
win
it
/.

Well
you
know
he
writes
in
his
memoir
it
was
u-
ha-
/-

And
if
Governor
Schwarzenegger
really
means
what
he
says
about
uh
the
California
Department
of
Corrections
with
emphasis
on
corrections
and
rehabilitation
he
should
spare
his
life
/.

and
you
've
been
--
you
've
been
studying
this
for
more
than
thirty
years
/.

Life
's
a
lot
different
/.

No
he
does
n't
do
any
of
that
/.

Thank
you
very
much
/.

More
than
two
million
in
need
of
food
/.

and
the
logic
of
survival
then
is
brutally
simple
/.

I
mean
here
we
've
just
got
this
hammer
blow
that
's
going
to
come
down
very
very
shortly
/.

but
they
have
fired
rubber
bullets
and
tear
gas
at
gangs
of
young
people
throwing
stones
/.

Got
it
/.

The
flagship
's
in
New
York
City
/.

And
I
definitely
am
/.

To
describe
it
in
one
sentence
,
in
the
past
the
economic
relationship
consisted
of
everybody
making
money
in
Hong
Kong
and
then
spending
it
in
the
mainland
.

There
is
a
standard
in
measuring
the
level
of
a
car
show
,
that
is
,
there
are
different
levels
in
international
auto
exhibitions
.

Uh-huh
.

This
would
enable
the
progress
of
the
talks
,
ah
,
to
continue
on
unbroken
.

And
also
during
my
many
years
of
working
in
the
lab
,
I
have
been
working
in
the
field
of
management
and
ideological
education
,
so
I
have
a
better
foundation
in
the
humanities
.

Uh-huh
.

The
direction
of
schools
,
ah
,
the
strengthening
of
safety
monitoring
inside
schools
,
ah
,
eh
,
the
strengthening
of
entrance
guards
,
the
monitoring
strength
of
entrance
guards
,
that
is
,
strengthening
to
some
degree
the
internal
restrictions
security
equipment
,

Um
,
I
think
that
the
police
should
all
have
their
own
district
of
jurisdiction
.

Are
you
planning
to
steal
it
.

It
's
Haidian
,
Uh
.

Right
.

Um
.

What
is
China
's
view
on
this
.

Uh-huh
.

We
should
be
able
to
do
that
.

In
addition
the
US
is
having
talks
across
the
ocean
with
Singapore
and
other
countries
on
,
this
,
free
trade
agreements
.

This
,
there
may
be
,
er
,
quite
a
number
of
concerns
,
yet
the
most
important
one
remains
the
security
concern
,
an
issue
of
its
relations
with
the
US
.

Um
,
after
an
eight
-
month
investigation
this
ten
-
person
group
,
in
the
end
,
eh
,
has
submitted
such
a
report
that
contains
seventy
-
nine
recommendations
.

Personal
expenditures
of
citizens
have
already
fallen
,
fallen
to
eh
,
from
50-something
percent
,
ah
,
to
the
current
40
-
plus
,
that
is
,
it
has
fallen
to
42
%
.

You
still
have
n't
told
me
that
specific
ideal
.

Yes
.

Well
hybrid
cars
have
n't
sold
very
well
in
China
,
it
seems
.

Why
were
there
so
many
.

It
's
because
,
eh
,
they
were
n't
considering
it
from
a
military
standpoint
,
but
rather
from
the
standpoint
of
political
confidence
.

Uh-huh
.

It
will
use
the
other
party
's
market
and
produce
the
Chery
brand
.

So
,
through
contact
and
communication
,
right
,
we
found
out
basic
area
of
operation
of
these
ten
or
so
cell
phones
was
around
Taiyuan
.

Yes
.

Recently
,
the
large
newspapers
,
the
Times
,
Britain
's
,
uh
,
BBC
,
uh
,
this
,
the
major
media
,
we
should
say
,
uh
,
uh
,
have
all
devoted
a
lot
of
space
to
this
matter
.

You
just
said
,
ah
,
secondly
,
we
need
to
look
at
the
new
products
,
and
thirdly
,
look
at
the
new
technology
.

You
are
absolutely
right
.

No
,
they
are
being
led
along
.

Yes
.

Well
,
ordinary
people
feel
,
ah
,
if
things
go
on
like
this
,
ah
,
the
current
situation
uh
plus
inflation
,
ordinary
people
,
ah
,
think
,
eh
,
that
I
must
save
my
money
to
maintain
my
current
livelihood
,
along
with
unforeseeable
things
in
the
future
.

Because
after
the
wolves
have
arrived
--
it
actually
describes
a
so
-
called
arrival
of
the
wolves
,
which
is
also
the
arrival
of
powerful
competitors
,
right
.

I
see
.

There
's
been
a
lot
going
on
lately
,
ah
.

Only
then
can
he
become
a
juror
.

Your
whole
--

Right
now
a
total
of
221
flights
are
affected
,
involving
about
,
eh
,
33,000
passengers
.

It
's
extremely
intense
.

It
will
bring
together
and
organize
all
of
the
car
R
-AMP-
D
teams
in
the
Beijing
region
.

Because
,
for
example
,
at
present
,
we
of
are
still
using
,
using
some
chips
from
abroad
as
some
of
our
chips
in
computers
.

These
,
uh
,
were
all
previously
classified
as
additional
,
supplementary
duties
.

This
,
production
capacity
,
ah
,
has
increased
tremendously
.

Uh-huh
.

So
he
especially
handed
over
to
me
the
role
of
representing
him
in
future
affairs
between
the
two
parties
of
the
Kuomintang
and
the
People
First
Party
,
and
to
represent
him
in
carrying
out
direct
communication
with
Chairman
Ma
.

What
if
a
watch
was
,
um
,
set
--
set
up
to
conduct
checks
at
toll
booths
.

That
is
,
it
was
one
percent
of
the
number
of
people
.

So
,
we
can
see
that
in
,
eh
,
this
process
,
China
continues
on
the
one
hand
to
strengthen
this
kind
of
links
with
developed
countries
,
and
at
the
same
time
also
can
not
avoid
engaging
in
some
negotiations
,
or
even
cross
swords
with
some
of
them
.

He
could
n't
perceive
your
resolution
and
your
capabilities
.

It
said
,
I
--
you
take
an
action
,
and
I
will
take
an
action
.

Well
,
now
North
Korea
has
already
conducted
a
nuclear
test
,
and
well
,
it
has
also
declared
itself
,
like
this
,
as
a
nuclear
country
,
and
wanted
to
participate
in
the
talks
in
this
role
.

Actually
,
we
two
are
the
exact
opposite
,
he
is
very
careful
,
very
careful
.

Yes
.

Your
parents
have
never
severely
reprimanded
you
,
right
.

Right
.

Er
,
have
you
been
to
an
auto
show
.

Uh-huh
.

So
,
it
's
extremely
nasty
in
nature
.

nice
to
be
with
you
Tim
/.

Well
I
we
'll
just
have
to
see
/.

I
really
do
think
that
the
Russians
have
generally
done
what
they
said
they
would
do
/.

Uh
we
have
a
s-
--
the
same
strategy
here
/.

I
do
n't
believe
uh
that
/.

That
's
why
it
was
very
important
to
get
this
uh
dossier
Iranian
dossier
to
the
Security
Council
and
why
the
diplomacy
that
we
've
been
working
over
the
last
uh
couple
of
years
to
get
the
Europeans
and
the
United
States
on
the
same
page
and
to
now
bring
the
Russians
and
the
Chinese
along
uh
has
been
so
important
/.

And
look
/.

The
sources
said
he
provided
information
{the?}
Iraqi
dictator
had
ambitions
for
a
nuclear
program
but
it
was
not
active
and
that
no
biological
weapons
were
being
produced
or
stockpiled
although
research
was
under
way
/.

But
people
are
being
asked
to
take
your
judgement
on
this
as
we
sit
here
this
morning
and
refer
to
previous
judgements
the
administration
made
/.

He
was
in
a
box
/.

American
forces
are
ceding
territory
/.

It
's
more
than
a
few
/.

This
is
a
young
democracy
that
is
uh
working
with
a
constitution
that
uh
like
many
constitutions
when
they
're
first
born
uh
e-
th-
the
conflicts
have
to
be
worked
out
/.

but
it
's
in
my
lifetime
that
uh
black
Americans
were
guaranteed
the
right
to
vote
/.

It
was
punishable
to
educate
women
/.

I
I
still
think
the
best
job
in
America
may
be
NFL
commisioner
/.

Not
not
going
to
t-
--
I
'm
not
going
to
do
that
/.

It
started
as
a
border
issue
in
uh
states
that
have
common
boundaries
with
Mexico
particularly
/.

Um
the
White
House
is
hanging
back
waiting
to
see
what
what
comes
out
of
th-
--
out
of
the
smoke
/.

Two
thousand
four
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
/.

or
they
just
want
to
focus
on
some
more
bloodshed
/.

but
they
do
not
dominate
the
news
/.

But
is
the
White
House
convinced
that
in
order
to
secure
the
base
of
the
Republican
Party
for
the
President
it
does
n't
hurt
to
go
after
the
media
a
little
bit
/?

Well
you
had
heard
this
kind
of
comment
all
of
us
had
privately
from
Republicans
on
the
hill
/.

it
's
unclear
if
anything
's
going
to
happen
/.

Fifty
percent
now
a
majority
say
the
Democrats
/.

And
you
've
got
to
knock
out
five
of
them
/?

Well
in
in
nineteen
ninety
-
four
you
talked
about
micro-changes
thirty
to
thirty
-
five
seats
in
the
House
/.

Ri-
I
mean
it
's
the
last
that
's
the
last
two
years
of
the
Bush
presidency
then
/.

That
c-
movie
Cool
Hand
Luke
sometimes
nothing
's
a
real
cool
hand
/.

we
're
making
progress
/.

Charlie
/?

Elisabeth
Bumiller
John
Harwood
David
Broder
Charlie
Cook
we
'll
be
right
back
/.

There
have
been
several
marine
operations
in
that
area
since
May
to
try
to
shut
down
those
smuggling
routes
/.

Hackett
a
lawyer
and
a
marine
reservist
who
saw
combat
during
a
seven
month
tour
bluntly
bashed
President
Bush
calling
him
quote
a
chickenhawk
and
worse
quote
a
son
of
a
bitch
/.

Joining
me
now
is
the
winner
of
yesterday
's
Ohio
election
Republican
Congresswoman
-
elect
Jean
Schmidt
/.

If
you
looked
at
his
ad
he
aligned
himself
with
the
president
because
he
caught
on
rather
quick
uh
when
he
won
the
uh
primary
election
and
he
had
gone
on
a
radio
station
and
said
uh
that
the
worst
threat
to
the
United
States
was
not
Osama
bin
Laden
but
the
President
that
uh
people
did
n't
like
that
/.

We
just
have
to
stay
the
course
/.

Uh
they
want
to
talk
about
national
issues
as
w-
including
Iraq
but
also
border
patrol
and
border
security
/.

And
later
the
congressional
committee
where
baseball
star
Raphael
Romero
testified
he
was
steroid
free
/.

Yeah
I
I
look
at
who
conservatives
really
are
/.

He
has
heard
the
President
and
the
Vice
President
accuse
uh
people
who
disagree
with
his
war
policy
like
Paul
Hackett
/.

You
know
who
one
of
the
Democrats
are
is
/?

Well
for
the
prisoners
uh
I
ca
n't
really
tell
you
/.

And
you
walk
up
to
it
/.

They
say
they
use
a
lot
of
positive
reinforcements
/.

Another
six
marines
from
that
same
unit
were
killed
in
an
ambush
in
Haditha
on
Monday
/.

The
league
suspended
Palmeiro
for
ten
days
this
week
for
flunking
a
drug
test
/.

Well
now
the
House
uh
Government
Reform
Committee
which
held
those
hearings
back
in
March
is
requesting
from
Major
League
Baseball
the
documents
relating
to
Palmeiro
's
drug
test
/.

He
's
agreed
today
to
verbally
to
release
all
the
documents
/.

Uh
He
's
uh
t-
rumored
to
be
considered
for
the
Hall
of
Fame
/.

That
's
ridiculous
/.

No
/.

Okay
/.

What
do
you
make
of
that
Ed
the
president
's
speech
today
/?

Let
me
ask
you
about
this
election
we
just
had
/.

Shrum
Bob
Shrum
what
do
you
make
of
this
/?

And
and
McCain
's
down
at
four
fifty
one
/.

Uh
b-
but
nonetheless
he
would
be
a
contender
for
our
nomination
no
question
/.

They
thought
they
were
going
to
run
against
maybe
Truman
again
/.

When
we
return
,
could
there
be
a
unity
ticket
in
the
presidential
race
of
two
thousand
eight
/?

I
think
we
do
n't
know
the
answer
to
that
yet
/.

If
things
go
as
bad
/-

but
do
you
think
that
's
even
possible
the
idea
of
a
fusion
ticket
between
uh
Biden
and
McCain
/?

I
mean
our
voters
will
probably
go
with
a
stylistical
contrast
to
Bush
somewhat
/.

But
you
're
a
professor
now
Bob
/.

And
I
'm
--
I
'm
only
half
kidding
/.

And
I
think
it
's
perfectly
clear
that
uh
that
he
made
the
argument
to
the
president
that
you
do
n't
wobble
on
this
one
,
that
this
is
an
important
player
in
our
agenda
with
the
United
Nations
/.

and
the
president
I
believe
did
the
right
thing
/.

Do
you
think
there
's
a
value
in
itself
in
having
someone
to
go
up
there
and
just
waste
the
place
I
mean
in
other
words
just
give
tough
speeches
try
to
humiliate
them
uh
try
to
get
them
out
and
get
them
straightened
out
by
just
making
fun
of
them
by
basically
trashing
some
of
those
Third
World
members
that
have
contributed
to
this
uh
horror
in
some
of
these
cases
you
mentioned
/?

You
're
dealing
with
a
guy
who
is
living
on
booze
most
of
the
time
and
delusions
and
movies
and
girlfriends
provided
for
him
/.

and
so
John
Bolton
was
n't
off
the
reservation
and
was
n't
speaking
out
of
school
/.

And
the
UN
recognized
it
now
/.

John
Bolton
has
showed
the
ability
to
do
that
/.

It
's
presently
scarred
presently
tainted
/.

The
president
's
power
to
make
recess
appointments
comes
from
the
Constitution
/.

The
United
Nations
is
in
trouble
/.

but
he
does
n't
have
a
lot
of
goodwill
up
there
/.

So
she
's
taken
this
this
posture
she
's
reflecting
the
president
's
view
as
adjusted
for
second
term
and
Bolton
is
going
to
have
to
follow
that
line
/.

I
mean
obviously
you
know
when
you
--
when
you
lead
a
nation
and
a
world
into
war
um
and
you
are
--
eh
and
you
have
the
kind
of
record
that
John
Bolton
has
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
went
to
Florida
and
fought
in
the
recount
I
think
it
you
know
the
Democrats
got
smart
/.

I
ca
n't
find
the
Democratic
position
on
any
issue
today
/.

What
are
you
talking
about
/?

No
absolutely
not
/.

In
fact
they
sort
of
nickeled
and
dimed
him
on
not
giving
him
a
fair
up
or
down
vote
on
much
less
relevant
points
/.

Is
there
any
chance
the
Senate
will
confirm
him
/?

And
if
it
were
an
up
or
down
vote
he
would
have
been
confirmed
because
he
had
a
majority
of
support
in
the
Senate
/.

Well
this
investigation
they
never
put
a
reporter
in
jail
--
they
never
put
a
reporter
in
jail
for
something
/.

I
think
they
've
got
a
huge
paper
trail
/.

So
this
is
not
a
Democratic
witch
hunt
/.

Worse
worse
Chris
way
/-

Thank
you
very
much
Ben
Ginsberg
Republican
strategist
Steve
McMahon
Democratic
strategist
he
said
breathlessly
/.

Do
they
like
us
/.

But
I
think
the
reality
is
that
Ms.
Morgan
like
most
reporters
are
really
spoon
-
fed
uh
their
experience
there
/.

I
covered
their
dead
bodies
/.

The
question
I
want
to
know
is
who
is
going
to
win
this
war
based
on
fighting
zeal
/?

They
wanted
the
thing
over
with
/.

Ah
as
a
solider
it
was
not
up
to
me
whether
or
not
we
went
in
/.

Yeah
/.

But
do
speak
of
do
people
speak
freely
--
do
people
speak
freely
when
there
is
a
Humvee
standing
next
to
them
/?

But
how
do
you
get
the
story
/?

Okay
her
turn
first
/.

That
's
exactly
right
/.

Yeah
right
right
/.

The
big
city
mayor
the
crime
fighter
BUT
pro-choice
pro-gun
-
control
pro-gay
-
rights
/.

Right
now
it
's
time
for
the
Abrams
report
with
Dan
/.

But
his
attorney
entered
the
plea
for
him
of
not
guilty
/.

Her
heart
was
full
of
love
a
love
she
willingly
shared
with
friends
and
family
/.

Very
very
little
spoken
between
them
/.

Every
All
the
other
patrons
had
left
the
bar
/.

Finally
there
are
no
witnesses
or
other
evidence
to
support
Littlejohn
's
claim
that
he
visited
his
mother
in
a
nursing
home
on
the
day
Imette
was
killed
/.

We
have
no
semen

Exactly
/.

um
Her
her
test
/-

Here
's
Kevin
O'Donnell
Littlejohn
's
attorney
on
Rita
's
show
uh
last
night
saying
that
his
client
took
the
subway
home
that
night
/.

How
were
you
personally
affected
by
the
fact
that
there
were
citizens
of
this
city
some
of
them
relatively
prominent
who
told
cops
lies
and
misleaded
this
investigation
/?

And
then
how
would
you
just
suddenly
remember
five
or
six
days
later
that
in
fact
he
was
the
one
who
asked
Littlejohn
to
escort
her
out
/?

And
this
woman
back
home
with
her
family
/.

I
believe
that
I
'm
going
through
therapy
and
doing
everything
that
I
can
possible
to
better
myself
for
the
community
and
society
/.

even
referred
to
police
officers
do
n't
like
to
testify
/.

What
's
your
reaction
to
that
/?

Actually
my
sister
had
overheard
uh
just
basic
/-

But
instead
of
saying
her
concern
because
of
of
what
she
did
to
him
um
instead
it
's
--
it
's
--
She
's
you
know
always
blaming
someone
else
/.

I
believe
she
does
have
mental
illnesses
um
/.

If
you
've
got
any
information
on
his
uh
whereabouts
please

New

She
's
back
where
she
belongs
/.

And
I
always
did
/.

So
why
did
it
take
her
so
long
to
come
forward
/?

Yes
and
under
the
law
that
would
be
a
crime
/.

He
's
almost
fifty

I
I
did
n't
know
that
you
did
n't
want
to
talk
about
that
at
all
/.

and
you
know
that
/.

But
how
did
she
come
to
uh
as
just
just
recently
/?

And
she
did
n't
want
that
/.

It
's
deeply
troubling
that
a
country
we
helped
liberate
is
Would
hold
a
person
to
account
because
they
chose
a
particular
religion
over
another
/.

Even
before
the
Taliban
there
was
also
an
Islamic

So
we
did

some
of
these

how
are
you
holding
up

Well
I
I
I
do
n't
know
if
it
's
--
he
's
the
only
one
that
they
're
looking
at
or
if
there
's
other
people
that
they
're
looking
at
/.

Matt
Biehl
thank
you
very
much
uh
for
for
taking
the
time
/.

I
think
that
they
were
seen
together
in
Richmond
um
either
Monday
or
Tuesday
/.

Thank
you
very
much
uh
Ms.
Sharp
/.

and
here
's
what
's
happening
/.

When
you
--
and
you
'll
have
to
trust
me
on
this
one
when
you
know
some
of
the
things
that
I
know
that
I
probably
should
n't
know
uh
that
take
me
in
this
direction
you
will
understand
why
I
have
said
with
fear
and
trepidation
why
I
have
um
said
that
I
believe
Harriet
Miers
will
be
a
good
justice
/.

I
I
think
some
of
the
things
that
he
's
talking
about
and
I
think
this
will
come
out
in
in
due
course
are
the
statements
that
were
made
by
Nathan
Hecht
her
friend
who
's
of
course
a
justice
on
the
Texas
Supreme
Court
which
was
on
the
news
um
right
immediately
after
the
nomination
/.

But
it
wait
/.

I
would
n't
b-
--
I
would
n't
be
surprised
for
the
first
time
to
see
Republican
and
Democratic
senators
unite
and
say
we
need
to
know
more
about
the
nominee
/.

H-
h-
here
here
's
wha-
--
here
's
what
we
've
got
/.

Well
and
I
think
--
but
here
's
what
you
do
/.

April
eighteenth
last
time
probation
hears
from
Duncan
/.

Look
I
I
agree
with
you
/.

The
family
wants
to
stop
this
for
the
future
/.

This
guy
should
have
never
been
let
out
and
should
have
never
been
given
a
bond
/.

He
's
fifty
two
five
eight
one
fifty
has
not
registered
with
the
authorities
/.

The
reality
they
could
n't
be
assured
he
would
not
vote
with
the
conservative
justices
on
many
of
the
same
controversial
issues
in
particular
Roe
v
Wade
/.

all
I
've
heard
is
skepticism
about
the
threat
/.

first
up
on
the
docket
tonight
we
got
an
interview
with
the
witness
who
led
investigators
to
a
landfill
in
the
search
for
Natalee
Holloway
/.

So
he
says
he
saw
some
men
drive
up
in
a
white
pickup
truck
men
that
he
says
he
later
recognized
to
be
the
three
suspects
in
this
case
/.

So
are
you
saying
that
the
authorities
in
uh
looked
into
this
guy
's
story
early
on
and
they
kind
of
pooh
-
poohed
it
and
then
EquuSearch
came
in
a
couple
weeks
later
and
said
wait
a
sec
,
wait
a
sec
,
let
's
give
this
guy
a
shot
here
and
they
followed
up
on
it
/?

I
believe
that
you
know
if
you
enter
on
the
right
side
you
have
to
have
a
valid
ID
/.

Joining
me
now
is
the
private
investigator
who
has
been
uh
working
with
Natalee
's
family
TJ
Ward
and
his
associate
Harold
Phipps
/.

I
mean
there
there
's
issues
of
that
's
come
up
/.

and
uh
he
c-
--
he
conveyed
it
from
Dutch
into
English
and
uh
showed
me
the
--
showed
me
the
statement
/.

Um
uh
Harold
finally
this
landfill
/.

Sorry
go
ahead
/.

Police
now
looking
into
three
men
who
might
've
had
something
to
do
with
his
disappearance
/.

Alright
/.

this
is
the
one
who
's
been
wanting
to
write
a
book
since
the
beginning
,
right
/?

We
told
them
we
did
n't
watch
it
/.

That
's
why
I
do
n't
yeah
ah
/.

Well
I
think
Eleanor
Cook
is
a
wacko
Dan
/.

There
's
no
remedy
/.

It
's
this
woman
saying
she
was
forced
and
bullied
right
into
c-
reaching
the
verdict
that
she
did
/.

Let
let
me
ask
you
/.

Number
one
I
think
it
would
have
been
a
better
book
if
he
would
have
been
found
guilty
/.

Hello
I
'm
Milissa
Rehberger
/.

and
we
intend
to
honor
that
request
/.

Uh
now
as
far
as
the
cruise
uh
I
was
on
the
cruise
that
uh
uh
day
/.

Any
seasoned
investigator
would
know
that
you
would
want
to
conduct
your
interviews
uh
of
possible
witnesses
immediately
after
the
crime
/.

Well
it
's
very
difficult
Dan
/.

At
times
it
sounded
like
furniture
was
being
actually
picked
up
and
dropped
/.

In
a
moment
I
'm
going
to
talk
with
two
very
courageous
mothers
who
both
lost
daughters
to
sex
offenders
/.

He
's
been
sentenced
to
death
for
those
crimes
/.

The
sex
offenders
that
we
have
caught
are
a
very
small
percentage
of
those
that
are
out
there
/.

Erin
uh
every
time
I
I
listen
to
that
tape
of
you
um
talking
to
uh
your
dau-
I
get
--
I
get
chills
/.

it
does
n't
take
away
/.

um
and
I
think
that
is
what
's
/-

Absolutely
/.

It
's
too
important
/.

One
man
in
Moorhead
Minnesota
thought
he
could
do
just
that
by
finding
good
use
for
all
/-

But
maybe
the
work
that
I
'm
doing
now
will
be
able
to
take
other
people
down
avenues
to
explore
with
more
tools
with
more
ability
to
experiment
with
more
ability
to
study
on
a
hands
-
on
basis
/.

Thank
you
Tim
/.

And
I
think
what
we
have
to
do
we
'll
see
a
lot
of
diplomacy
over
the
next
couple
of
days
/.

I
simply
do
n't
see
why
it
's
in
the
interest
of
the
United
States
to
get
those
countries
out
of
the
way
and
only
deal
with
North
Korea
directly
/.

and
that
was
spectacularly
unsuccessful
/.

You
know
it
's
a
--
it
's
a
very
unreliable
and
unpredictable
regime
/.

But
the
time
for
talk
is
over
/.

Tim
um
obviously
we
profoundly
disagree
with
um
some
of
the
statements
that
we
've
just
heard
/.

and
that
's
why
we
've
put
in
place
this
policy
designed
to
take
it
away
from
them
/.

I
will
not
stand
by
as
peril
draws
closer
and
closer
/.

And
then
in
two
thousand
four
there
's
a
tyrant
in
North
Korea
that
wants
to
develop
a
nuclear
weapon
/.

and
you
you
see
momentum
building
in
the
UN
security
council
toward
a
very
tough
chapter
seven
resolution
against
them
/.

Tim
I
've
been
to
Europe
twenty
times
over
the
last
fourteen
months
to
talk
to
the
Europeans
and
the
Russians
and
Chinese
about
Iran
for
instance
/.

We
have
a
very
strong
and
active
government
/.

And
we
are
back
/.

But
right
now
our
policy
is
not
working
/.

They
get
economic
assistance
/.

And
I
think
a
decent
interval
now
and
some
work
at
the
United
Nations
is
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
/.

Um
the
reason
for
that
/-

In
hindsight
do
you
still
stand
by
that
preemptive
military
strike
/?

Uh
you
do
take
that
step
/.

But
early
on
I
said
that
they
they
did
on
CBS
/.

Ambassador
Gallucci
you
negotiated
that
ninety
four
agreement
/.

Right
/.

We
had
some
transparency
a
measure
of
it
/.

North
Korea
can
not
be
allowed
to
develop
a
nuclear
bomb
/.

I
was
in
North
Korea
when
that
happened
/.

The
only
way
to
find
out
whether
they
'll
ultimately
give
up
those
weapons
is
to
do
a
deal
/.

They
have
human
rights
violations
/.

And
thirty
one
years
ago
on
Meet
The
Press
then
president
Gerald
Ford
talked
about
being
sixty
and
serving
as
president
/.

that
's
the
criteria
I
would
use
/.

This
woman
is
very
wrong
/.

Thanks
for
watching
/.

Nor
did
it
require
the
president
to
close
Guantanamo
/.

And
in
this
war
on
terrorism
you
do
n't
have
set
battlefields
/.

Why
should
n't
our
servicemen
be
/-

What
are
we
--
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
people
/?

The
House
voted
this
week
on
a
resolution

Let
it
be
a
fair
and
down
the
middle
investigation
/.

Senator
McConnell
has
the
administration
and
its
conservative
supporters
now
embarked
on
a
calculated
campaign
to
demonize
The
New
York
Times
and
other
newspapers
but
particularly
The
New
York
Times
as
a
political
calculus
because
it
'll
help
in
the
midterm
elections
/?

When
it
comes
to
difficult
situations
and
clearly
Iraq
now
is
one
And
uh
this
administration
has
a
penchant
for
diversion
and
scapegoating
/.

you
're
going
to
the
election
to
to
the
voters
in
November
/.

And
the
fact
the
the
United
States
Senate
does
n't
get
it
should
n't
surprise
you
/.

The
aftermath
has
been
much
more
difficult
/.

and
I
think
it
needs
to
tilt
toward
uh
border
security
/.

Joe
Lieberman
on
the
Iraq
war
/.

And
we
're
not
going
to
speculate
about
things
afterwards
/.

I
'm
sure
you
'll
want
to
/.

Speaking
of
debates
and
rivalries
Roll
Call
Newspaper
reports
Senator
Schumer
that
you
and
your
fellow
New

senator
Hillary
Clinton
have
such
an
intense
rivalry
that
this
week
you
and
Harry
Reid
your
majority
leader
your
Democratic
leader
rather
tried
to
exclude
her
from
a
news
conference
to
announce
one
of
her
pet
issues
/.

Will
you
support
her
for
president
if
she
chooses
to
run
for

/?

So
Bill
Bennett
what
is
the
harm
in
what
The
New
York
Times
and
other
newspapers
did
last
week
in
publishing
their
stories
/?

Well
here
we
are

We
're
putting
banks

on
notice

Richard

a
thing
against
this

how
do
you
plead

John
is
this
policy
of

use
the

In

we
talked

let
me

the

put

No

What
I
found
shocking
about
the
editorial
was
the
assertion
that
The
New

did
not
act
in
good
faith
in
making
that
judgment

And
on

only
have
about
fifteen
thirty
seconds
/.

On
Sunday
morning
June
thirteenth
nineteen
seventy
one
the
front
page
of
The
New

Times
featured
a
photo
of
a
smiling
President
Nixon
escorting
his
daughter
Tricia
on
her
wedding
day
/.

The
government
is
not
the
executive
branch

so
i
ask
you
,
what
was
your
most
epic
road
trip
?

that
is
once
you
big
kids
have
me
laughing
so
hard
i
forget
about
all
those
ancient
blood
oaths
i
swore
never
to
say
a
word
...

Only
a.m.
had
not
foreseen
the
chance
that
the
escape
he
used
the
last
time
could
have
become
overgrown
with
brambles
.

I
quite
think
the
blouberg
trip
we
went
on
deserving
of
epic
status
.

then
i
said
'
um
,
how
much
for
all
night
?
'

trust
me
on
this
,
if
nothing
else
.

and
yet
they
survived
another
40
years
to
be
buried
in
mounds
of
flowers
.

suffice
to
say
all
of
the
above
are
now
on
my
bobmart
shopping
list
.

this
at
,
um
,
12
hours
divided
by
two
,
times
five
,
plus
about
65
equals
,
um
,
something
like
95
mph
.

I
do
n't
think
any
part
of
that
trip
translates
well
to
North
American
experiences
,
except
for
the
thunderstorm
coming
on
just
as
we
were
near
a
cave
.

and
when
I
got
to
the
crest
I
could
see
the
first
flaming
roadblock
down
below
.

and
I
saw
several
machetes
aimed
at
my
head
.

I
asked
how
much
they
wanted
.

I
liked
the
girls
best
.

They
turned
my
pockets
out
and
took
all
my
money
.

He
was
shaking
,
swept
up
in
the
passion
of
power
;

and
I
knew
that
if
I
did
n't
pay
up
they
would
burn
the
car
.

I
smashed
into
the
fire
,

They
contain
toxic
chemicals
--

E-waste
and
construction
waste
are
two
potentially
profitable
steams

What
we
need
to
do
is
to
move
the
recycling
process
forward
into
the
repair
world
.

As
a
political
city
,
they
created
so
much
waste
product
they
flooded
the
market
.

It
was
installed
by
compressing
four
little
rubber
studs
into
holes
in
the
sheet
metal
,
and
sealed
with
a
ten
inch
oblong
flat
gasket
.

She
carefuly
forgets
all
that
when
she
needs
something
and
it
turns
out
that
I
have
just
the
right
framitz
to
manufacture
a
repair
piece
for
her
thing
-
a
-
bob
.

You
may
regard
my
views
as
those
of
the
proverbial
taxi
driver
,
which
you
are
supposed
to
question
,
when
you
visit
a
country
.

These
22
countries
,
with
all
their
oil
and
natural
resources
,
have
a
combined
GDP
smaller
than
that
of
Netherlands
plus
Belgium
and
equal
to
half
of
the
GDP
of
California
alone
.

Suicide
murders
are
not
a
new
invention

But
if
you
want
to
murder
by
suicide
,
you
do
not
have
to
board
a
plane
in
order
to
explode
yourself
and
kill
many
people
.

The
poorest
region
in
the
world
,
by
far
,
is
Africa
.

Until
Europe
wakes
up
,
this
unity
will
not
be
achieved
.

Little
children
are
raised
on
deep
hatred
and
on
admiration

called

Do
you
raid
terrorist
headquarters
,
hidden
in
a
mental
hospital

What
can
we
do
about
it
?

It
is
not
surprising
that
Iran
is
so
active
in
trying
to
incite
a
Shiite
uprising
in
Iraq
.

It
is
also
important
to
act
decisively
against
the
campaign
of
lies
and
fabrications
and
to
monitor
those
Western
media
who
collaborate
with
it
out
of
naivety

``
We
do
have
a
saying
in
America
:

In
the
documented
version
of
reality
,
derived
from
litigation
and
relatively
obscure
investigations
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
,
Searle
turned
out
to
enjoy
its
notable
rise
less
thanks
to
Rumsfeldian
innovative
managerial
genius
than
to
old
-
fashioned
reckless
marketing
of
pharmaceuticals
already
on
the
shelf
and
the
calling
in
of
lobbying
``
markers
''
via
its
well
-
connected
Republican
CEO
.

While
,
over
the
next
12
years
,
Bush
went
on
to
the
vice
-
presidency
and
presidency
,
and
Jim
Baker
--
equally
detested
by
Rumsfeld
--
went
along
with
his
patron
to
White
House
staff
and
cabinet

,
Rumsfeld
would
build
his
Searle
fortune
and
bide
his
time
.

They
planted
guidance
transmitters
along
the
low
-
level
flight
path
under
Jordanian
and
Iraqi
radar
to
the
point
of
painting
the
target
with
lasers
.

The
Rumsfeld
-
Cheney
recompense
,
at
vast
cost
to
the
nation
and
world
,
would
be
their
fierce
seizure
of
power
after
September
11
,
2001
.

Rumsfeld
began
his
Pentagon
reprise
by
seizing
on
a
dead
Russian
marshal
and
an
octogenarian
Washington
bureaucrat
few
had
ever
heard
of
.

He
had
been
a
protege
of
think
-
the
-
unthinkable
,
World
War
III
theorist
Herman
Kahn
,
and
then
,
via
Henry
Kissinger

Kraemer

gone
to
work
for
Kissinger
at
the
National
Security
Council

in
the
first

term
.

Historically
,
he
was
their

patron
,

figurehead
,
but
never
really
of
them

never
a

much
of
what
they
pursued

Did
n't
I
read
somewhere
that
some
of
those
office
buildings
were
considered
worn
out
and
that
they
would
be
demolished
and
replaced
rather
than
refurbished
?

Virginia
needs
balanced
job
growth
.

We
have
far
,
far
more
people
in
homes
than
we
have
jobs
for
them
.

it
gives
them
proximity
to
a
wider
range
of
employment
locations
.

One
might
also
ask
:
At
what
point
does
it
become
unfair
to
load
all
of
the
costs
on
the
newcomer
?

employers
want
to
be
``
near
''
a
qualified
workforce
but
employees
-LRB-
note
they
use
the
word
residents
-RRB-
continue
to
seek
...
homes
in
more
distant
communities
.

It
might
be
that
there
is
still
sufficient
reason
to
spend
billions
of
scarce
dollars
on
Metro
,
but
easing
traffic
congestion
is
n't
one
of
them
.

Maryland
has
proposed
selling
land
to
raise
money
,
Fairfax
to
support
affordable
housing
,
and
The
Vint
Hill
Economic
Development
Authority
is
arguably
the
largest
developer
in
Fauquier
.

In
this
case
the
newcomers
are
not
causing
any
new
requirements
,

This
has
already
happened
with
some
gated
communities
.

Schools
and
Prisons
and
other
buildings
can
eventually
wear
out
and
need
replacement
.

but
they
could
well
be
tied
to
major
port
expansions
slated
for
Hampton
Roads
.

Sounds
like
a
plan
.

I
always
thought
high
speed
on
The
Peninsula
connecting
to
Richmond
and
DC
was
the
ticket
,

Let
's
not
forget
the
``
maintenance
''
costs
.

We
have
tried
private
tolls
before
,
and
they
did
n't
work
.

Similar
stories
may
now
be
said
to
have
been
``
debunked
,
''
without
examination
or
a
straining
of
battlefield
ethics
.

It
's
not
right
,

A
-
non
-
entity
.

They
only
started
the
way

That
would
be
a
massive
nuclear
strike
,
incincerating
all
opposition
before
it
could
mobilize
,
and
using
its
new
warfighter
technology
to
mop
up
everything
else
.

A
Breakdown
in
Thinking

That
sort
of
moral
action
seemed
fairly
unremarkable
to
people
back
then
.

The
kid
who
bought
that
toy
would
be
in
their
mid
to
late
20s
right
now
,
possibly
with
a
tour
or
two
of
Iraq
under
their
belts
.

Hell
,
I
bet
more
Americans
do
more
research
to
buy
a
f*cking
clothes
dryer
than
they
did
before
they
bought
this
war
,
hook
line
-AMP-
sinker
.

In
the
East
,
people
say
,
``
Do
not
impose
on
others
what
you
would
not
want
do
to
yourself
.
''

So
they
promote
and
use
communists
,
who
actually
want
to
get
rid
of
the
form
of
U.S.
government
as
a
stepping
stone
to
world
domination
.

This
probably
severed
the
Chinese
zeitgeist
from
its
cultural
and
spiritual
base
.

things
they
would
probably
have
never
thought
themselves
capable
of
.

To
think
otherwise
is
to
be
totally
naive
and
uninformed
.

instance
of
the
intentional
killing

His
Reward

Was
Pat
Benatar
incorrect
when
she
said
``
Hell
Is
For
Children
?
''

``
God
''
never
did
shit
to
you
that
you
know
of
,

At
least
a
soldier
on
a
battlefield
has
the
excuse
that
he
was
following
orders
,
or
that
in
a
free
-
fire
zone
he
could
n't
tell
the
guys
in
the
black
hats
from
the
guys
in

because
accidents
fucking
happen

If

There
are
24
days
left
to
patch
together
a
budget
before
the
fiscal
year
ends
.

I
believe
that
it
would
be
better
to
imperil
our
bond
rating
than
to
pass
a
budget
that
continues
the
taxation
practices
of
the
past
two
general
assemblies
.

Ronald
Reagan
was
a
convert
,
a
true
believer
,
who
actually
believed
the
same
stuff

a
huge
mess
with
figuring
out
pay
and
benefits
for
state
workers
,
who
are
not
going
to
be
happy
about
this

but
I
guess
what
I
can
not
understand
is
that
all
things
being
equal
..
does
n't
population
growth
result
in
MORE
tax
revenues
that
would
be
allocated
presumedly
as
they
were
before
-
in
other
words
priorities
remain
the
same
in
terms
of
allocations
?

State
employees
,
who
will
be
off
duty
if
the
budget
is
not
passed
and
Kaine
does
NOT
move
ahead
,
would
include
:

Then
try
to
tell
me
that
shutting
down
the
state
government
is
n't
going
to
be
noticed
by
the
average
citizen
.

Everything
Michael
has
done
and
said
during
the
past
20
years
has
been
against
his
own
apparent
self
-
interest
,
beginning
with
unrelenting
surgical
assaults
on
his
erstwhile
good
looks
,
to
hanging
his
child
-LRB-
and
crotch
for
that
matter
-RRB-
out
to
dry
,
to
entering
details
of
his
bedroom
antics
into
the
public
domain
.

and
like
Oskar
,
who
found
respite
in
the
beating
of
his
tin
drum
,
Michael
found
solace
on
stage
,
performing
his
music
.

However
,
those
whose
minds
were
decided
on
his
guilt
before
the
trial
began
will
not
be
changed
by
the
verdict
,
just
as
Michael
's
essential
nature
will
not
have
changed
.

He
's
moved
on
since
his
aquittal
,
like
Gary
Glitter
did
after
his
1999
conviction
,
having
departed
last
June
for
a
Bahrain
``
vacation
''
from
which
he
's
yet
to
emerge
.

Yet
we
should
n't
discount
the
suspicion
,
either
,
particularly
given
some
of
Michael
's
paranormal
interests
and
peculiar
associations
.

This

There

no

made
of
this
in

the

or

I
'm
surprised
I
have
n't
heard
this
mentioned
anywhere
before
,
as
it
ties
in
perfectly
with
Jeff
's
Bizarro
Jacko
Tabloid
post
:

I
think
the
practice
of
black
magic
is
something
she
and
her
brother
have
in
common
.

Frank
Wolf
represented
an
old
``
black
operations
''
soul
-
robbing
agency
known
as
the
Fellowship
Foundation
.

anonymous

Suddenly
,
it
is
night
,
and
a
tarp
-
covered
,
skyscraper
-
sized
structure
looms
over
the
poor
nation
as
choppers
spray
spotlights
across
it
.

BTW
Jeff
-
I
'd
caught
the
Geller
/
Jackson
connection
a
while
back
and
posted
on
the
discussion
board
.

See
,
it
's
the
Hegelian
dialectic
at
work
.

A
far
cry
from
the
stealing
of
children
.

About
MJ
they
said
,
he
is
definately
not
a
JW
,
despite
what
he
says
.

I
have
n't
really
delved
into
Barrie
's
psyche
from
the
biographical
end
,
it
's
Peter
and
Wendy
as
an
extraordinary
piece
of
writing
that
has
always
fascinated
me
.

It
bought
about
200
new
buses
and
added
rush
-
hour
trains
,
express
bus
routes
and
more
park
-
and
-
ride
lots
.

Would
the
experiment
have
been
as
successful
if
they
had
not
spent
the
money
?

In
Southern
California
,
there
are
at
least
two
tollways
with
variable
pricing
that
fluctuates
with
traffic
density
.

Larry
,
the
cell
phone
analogy
is
brilliant
.

The
people
of
Northern
Virginia
-LRB-
i.e.
the
buyers
of
the
product
offered
under
congestion
``
pricing
''
-RRB-
would
then
have
a
choice
-
like
they
do
today
with
cell
phone
service
.

If
you
want
to
call
that
``
placing
a
toll
gate
on
the
community
,
''
I
suppose
you
can
.

The
central
area
is
patrolled
by
girls
,
most
of
whom
seem
not
to
be
French
,
but
who
cheerfully
offer
,
in
a
variety
of
languages
,
a
sex
massage
.

It
is
easy
to
see
this
as
a
typically
Gallic
overstatement
.

One
of
the
most
powerful
cases
made
in
favour
of
them
has
been
regularly
made
since
the
early
1990s
by
Michele
Barzach
,
the
Conservative
ex-minister
for
health
,
who
argued
for
controlled
brothels
,
both
gay
and
straight
,
as
a
way
of
dealing
with
Aids
.

''
and
,
of
course
,
that
demands
respect
.
''

So
why
read
Houellebecq
or
Millet
?

Others
look
sinister
and
sheepish
in
equal
measure
.

``
I
'd
love
to
find
a
way
to
pay
for
the
things
we
need
by
not
raising
taxes
and
using
existing
revenue
,

Yeah
,
I
'd
say
it
was
too
early
to
claim
victory
.

Zoning
was
developed
in
New
York
to
encourage
people
to
move
out
of
the
city
center
,
subsidized
by
flat
fares
on
the
trolleys
.

Bob
,
No
,
I
would
n't
define
victory
as
simply
not
raising
taxes
--
although
I
definitely
would
like
to
defer
raising
taxes
as
long
as
prudently
possible
.

and
I
'll
fight
for
an
adequate
public
facilities
ordinance
as
my
number
one
priority
.

If
more
density
is
good
for
some
areas
,
why
not
all
?

None
of
the
development
we
have
was
built
when
the
facilities
were
adequate
,
and
much
of
it
was
built
specifically
to
get
away
from
places
that
had
inadequate
facilities
and
were
over
built
.

And
that
's
a
good
point
about
Kaine
's
``
gasoline
tax
.
''

My
interest
is
the
politics
of
it
.

Unfortunately
,
for
some
,
strategic
stalemate
is
just
as
good
as
any
other
means
of
conservation
,
never
mind
whatever
other
harm
it
does
.

Even
I
thought
there
might
be
a
lag
of
three
or
four
years
.

It
was
very
nice
of
y'all
to
oblige
us
.

Since
our
road
expenditures
nowhere
near
match
the
increase
in
business
or
state
domestic
product
,
it
is
no
wonder
we
suffer
congestion
problems
.

I
drive
past
Watkins
Landing
every
morning
and
evening
.

How
much
traffic
congestion
could
have
been
alleviated
had
the
money
been
applied
to
other
pressing
road
projects
or
,
god
forbid
,
even
non-road
projects
.

They
were
purchased
from
landowners
and
citizens
who
were
ready
and
willing
to
sell
at
the
offered
price
.

But
to
be
fair
,
if
we
are
going
to
eliminate
all
opportunity
for
those
people
other
than
the
negative
opportunity
of
growing
crops
-LRB-
supposedly
for
our
own
tax
benefit
-RRB-
then
they
need
to
be
compensated
,

Under
that
criteria
,
nothing
will
ever
be
built
anywhere
.

But
using
bad
arguments
against
others
that
could
equally
well
apply
to
ourselves
does
nothing
to
help
the
situation
.

There
might
be
some
other
alternative
,

That
's
the
Virginia
way
.
-RRB-

But
clearly
,
using
tolls
to
pay
for
Metro
-LRB-
instead
of
road
improvements
-RRB-
while
simultaneously
claiming
that
cars
and
roads
do
n't
pay
their
way
is
both
nutso
and
egregiously
unfair
.

Literally
.

one
day
Abather
confronted
the
dean
,

It
was
as
if
they
had
suddenly
found
themselves
citizens
of
the
51st
state
.

and
then
a
U.S.
patrol
appeared

It
was
in
Jordan
that
Abather
and
Balqes
discovered
the
limitations
of
their
friendship
with
the
United
States
.

Having
recently
suffered
two
terrorist
attacks
,
Jordan
had
enacted
a
ban
on
entry
for
Iraqi
men
aged
17
to
35
.

Suddenly
,
Abather
heard
gunshots
.

after
crossing
a
30
-
foot
no
man
's
land
we
repeated
the
process
at
the
second
wall
.

-LRB-
An
Amman
-
based
aid
worker
later
told
me
that
American
diplomats
are
so
distraught
by
the
policies
they
are
charged
with
representing
that
``
it
just
takes
a
few
gin
and
tonics
and
they
'll
break
down
.
''
-RRB-

Jordanian
government
spokesman
Nasser
S.
Judeh
told
me
that
his
country
,
a
staunch
U.S.
ally
and
aid
recipient
,
``
certainly
needs
help
,
and
has
held
discussions
with
U.S.
diplomats
''
about
this
issue
.

Balqes
was
more
fearful
--
twice
in
the
past
month
,
suspicious
men
had
shown
up
at
the
apartment
.

So
reads
an
accurate
testimonial
to
the
personal
and
artistic
sentiment
of
this
odd
and
serious
filmmaker
.

It
suffices
that
I
was
not
an
exception
among
my
compatriots
,
since
this
is
a
very
Spanish
characteristic
,
and
our
art
,
exponent
of
the
Spanish
spirit
,
was
impregnated
with
these
two
sentiments
.

He
went
on
to
say
,
``
The
purpose
of
surrealism
was
not
to
create
a
new
literary
,
artistic
,
or
even
philosophical
movement
,
but
to
explode
the
social
order
,
to
transform
life
itself
'
-LRB-

-RRB-
.

The
surreal
qualities
in
Bunuel
's
films
can
be
traced
to
a
number
of
sources
,

The
aim
of
the
film
was
not
exclusively
to
shock
,
but
to
incendiarially
affect
the
collective
conscience
.

Simon
heroically
resists
her
temptations
at
every
turn
despite
her
various
disguises
;
first
,
a
priest
,
then
a
shepherd
,
and
finally
as
the
Savior
himself
.

Bunuel
twists
this
meaning
to
imply
that
the
specter
haunting
the
bourgeoisie
is
``
the
possibility
of
its
own
freedom
unburdened
by
the
dead
ends
of
sexual
license
,
willful
irrationality
,
and
the
liberty
to
go
beyond
the
self
-
indulgent
eccentricities
of
the
individual
ego

After
which
I
turn
over
on
my
side
and
expire
.

Virginians
and
Americans
will
adapt
to
higher
gas
prices
if
government
does
not
interfere
.

Let
us
hope
that
Gov.
Kaine
,
who
prides
himself
on
straight
talk
,
begins
leveling
with
the
people
of
Virginia
.

So
,
I
ask
seriously
,
what
are
average
hard
-
working
families
to
do
?

There
's
not
much
that
average
,
hard
-
working
families
can
do
in
the
short
run
to
cope
with
higher
gas
prices
except
hope
that
their
paychecks
keep
pace
with
inflation
.

Considering
the
wide
variety
in
local
and
state
fuel
taxes
the
near
uniformity
of
the
pump
price
across
state
lines
is
...
curious
.

However
,
both
Montana
and
Utah
have
average
prices
that
are
significantly
lower
than
either
VA
or
NC
.

Did
I
really
say
that
?

BTW
13
%
more
new
home
sales
last
year
,
in
spite
of
higher
rates
,

To
them
we
say
that
the
people
of
Palestine
were
living
safely
and
securely
in
their
country
,
which
was
a
Syrian
province
under
Ottoman
Sultanate
rule
..

The
civil
war
-LRB-
God
Almighty
protect
us
from
it
-RRB-
is
a
catastrophe
in
the
real
sense
.

But
I
have
never
read
a
proverb
by
a
woman
making
fun
of
men
...
how
sensible
women
are
!
:-LRB-

So
where
is
the
Ministry
of
Trade
to
give
us
the
main
reason
for
these
increases
in
all
goods
?

But
Hamas
has
managed
to
come
through
its
first
difficult
days
in
power
...
and
has
managed
to
establish
its
presence
through
its
continued
and
sincere
work
in
spite
of
circumstances
that
were
enough
to
bring
down
any
other
government
.

That
is
why
Condoleezza
Rice
's
visit
to
Egypt
,
Saudi
Arabia
and

of

comes
at

For
over
10
years
,
Al

Wafd
has
conducted
a
press
campaign
against
the
importation
of
Canadian
rapeseed

after
local

international

proved
its
great
danger

I
was
not

what
happened
on

on

was
complaining
about

denying

After
the

disgraceful
failure
whether
at
the
world
championship

even
at

level
,
like
now
in

in

,
personally
and
on
behalf
of
the
female
gender
,
I
express
to
you
,
the
young
men
of
Saudi
Arabia
,
our
complete
readiness
as
members
of
the
female
gender
,
to
watch
you
bring
about
the
defeat

of

This

companies
make
at

30

Without
a
doubt
,
the
American
administration
is
primarily
responsible
for
igniting
new
crises
or
failing
to
put
out
old
ones
in

Doctors
explained
that
this
percentage
of

is
harmful
for

especially
in
children
after
it
was
found
that
there
is
a
link
between
using
kohl
and
lead
poisoning
in
children
,
and
the
brain
disorders
it
causes
because
children
's
eyes
can
not
produce
tears
to
wash
external
pollutants
out

construct

help
the

,
rehabilitate
and
assist

and
eliminate

,
spinsterhood
,

corruption

Why
should
you
care
about
the

and
electricity
bill
?

My
colleague
had
been
asked
by
an
organization
concerned
with
handicapped
younth
to
prepare
a
cultural
,
entertaining
,
and
educational
program
for
this
kind
of
audience
...

Just
that
it
did
not
lose
...
that
was
a
victory
.

But
as
a
chairman
of
a
political
party
in
Kurdistan
who
has
a
history
of
resistance
in
the
Kurdish
liberation
movement
,
he
should
have
called
things
by
their
real
names
and
avoided
the
barren
justification
that
previous
plaintiffs
and
witnesses
used
when
they
mentioned
the
role
of
merchants
of
war
,
agents
of
the
former
regime
who
are
called
the
leaders
of
the
Kurdish
clans
,
or
consultants
as
the
former
dictator
authority
called
them
.

But
I
also
back
curricular
decentralization
in
such
a
way
that
details
,
standards
and
motor
,
cognitive
and
social
skills
are
defined
and
then
specialist
companies
can
come
in
and
set
up
curricula
according
to
the
areas
in
question
because
the
experiences
and
interests
of
town
people
differ
from
the
skills
of
village
people
and
so
on
.

How
did
Egypt
's
production
of
long
-
fiber
cotton
,
the
best
in
the
world
,
drop
from
12
million
tons
to
just
four
tons
?

This
kind
of
spurious
marriage
,
which
takes
advantage
of
girls
'
poverty
,
caused
awful
human
tragedies
.

If
we
multiply
that
by
30
days
,
it
would
be
equivalent
to
the
salary
of
a
Saudi
employee
in
a
phone
kiosk
,
maybe
more
.

There
are
only
two
major
reasons
that
may
make
the
referees
favor
one
team
over
another
.

Unfortunately
politics
is
a
breeding
ground
for
human
monsters
.

It
also
reminds
me
of
something
that
I
experienced
several
years
ago
,
also
related
to
an
airport
and
meeting
people
.

I
tried
my
best
to
comfort
him
then
and
told
him
to
think
of
a
way
slowly

Someone
at
the

yard

it

In
China
the
primary
function
of
the
income
tax
is
to
increase
the
state
's
financial
revenues
;
it
is
not
to
regulate
the
income
gap
.

In
China
,
freedom
,
human
rights
,
democracy
,
happiness
and
all
the
other
most
effective
benefits
that
society
can
offer
refer
only
to
20
%
of
the
people
.

But
these
are
countries
ruled
by
law
,
where
official
income
is
all
recorded
,
citizen
's
incomes
are
fully
transparent
,
and
therefore
the
personal
income
tax
can
easily
achieve
the
effect
of
regulating
income
distribution
.

When

everybody

Let

say
it
again

it
suits
the

for
China
to
become
a
disunited
country
with
no
production
capacity
and
no
fighting
ability

The
critical
path
of
success

If
you
have
the
ability
,
you
can
hope
to
succeed
.

Below
I
'm
going
to
discuss
some
of
the
areas
that
you
need
to
pay
attention
to
when
setting
up
an
Internet
business
:

Your
mind
needs
to
be
sharp
;
the
Internet
offers
virtually
unlimited
business
opportunities
;
maybe
it
's
just
a
small
opportunity
,
but
you
should
seize
it
.

Like
gaddy
,
for
example
,
who
first
badmouths
USTC

for
not
wanting
to
contribute
money
,
says
he
himself
has
some
money
,
and
then
wants
to

of

--
Some
Thoughts
on
the
Attitude
of
Benign
Inheritance
towards
Social
Reform
.

At
last
,
I
would
like
to
admonish
sincerely
and
earnestly
those
who
blindly
oppose
,
hate
and
even
suppress
planned
economy
,
public
ownership
and
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
,
especially
the
"
mainstream
elite
scholars
"
including
Wu
Jinglian
,
who
insist
on
smearing
the
"
father
"
to
the
end
:
do
not
treat
the
"
fathers
"
on
which
the
new
civilization
is
based
barbarously
,
against
your
conscience
and
frantically
for
immediate
gains
.

Friends
,
it
's
always
friends
who
help
me
at
key
moments
.

Peasants
blocking
roads
and
clashing
with
the
police
:
who
should
reflect
on
this
?

Although
the
peasants
'
blocking
the
road
was
against
the
law
,
the
police
can
maintain
order
according
to
the
law
,

Be
Your
Own
Psychiatrist
.

With
some
psychological
knowledge
,
he
knew
it
was
a
symptom
of
mental
disorder
,
so
he
immediately
sought
help
from
professionals
and
received
treatment
soon
.

The
wise
man
was
greatly
surprised
;
he
too
jumped
up
and
said
:
You
mean
...
life
is
n't
a
river
?

The
way
to
treat
this
is
:
control
the
amount
of
animal
and
vegetable
oils
we
consume
and
eat
more
vegetables
containing
chlorophyll
.

That
is
,
it
's
a
big
category
.

●
Sell
-
offs
by
big
collectors
:
in
the
stamp
speculation
in
1997
,
quite
a
few
large
collectors
having
financial
resources
also
bought
back
their
stamp
sheets
from
this
period
as
short
-
term
investments
.

The
difficulty
of
using
stamps
for
the
general
public
is
a
major
sticking
point
.

This
involves
the
restructured
postal
administration
taking
part
in
market
operations
,
reducing
the
pressure
of
discount
stamps
.

But
Director
Ba
,
as
an
intellectual
who
always
spoke
the
truth
and
stood
up
for
what
was
right
,
should
have
known
that
the
lifelong
term
system
of
leaders
is
not
good
,
and
should
have
been
opposed
.

If
you
read
the
afterwords
he
's

you
'll
know

Law
has
a
clear

bourgeois

no

would
be

Regardless
of
the
accuracy
of
various
comments
,
China
must
be
prepared
to
cope
with
the
US
economic
recession
.

Foreign
-
funded
processing
export
consumes
domestic
electricity
and
water
resources
substantially
.

As
an
expectation
,
there
will
be
leading
overreactions
in
financial
and
real
estate
areas
by
around
2015
.

She
looked
not
bad
;
she
was
a
former
co-worker
of
our
classmate
's
wife
;
her
appearance
was
proper
,
and
eating
and
all
was
no
problem
;
I
'm
just
an
ordinary
older
WSN
.

To
put
it
simply
,
the
rebalancing
theory
holds
that
if
the
gap
between
countries
with
trade
surpluses
and
deficits
continues
to
expand
,
it
will
harm
the
sustained
growth
of
the
world
's
economy
.

Just
as
the
bursting
of
the
2000
-
01
stock
market
bubble
led
to
mild
collapse
,
I
am
worried
that
people
are
discarding
too
quickly
the
risk
of
a
similar
situation
occurring
in
2007
.

My
greatest
concern
is
that
people
continue
to
treat
lightly
the
continually
booming
risk
assets
markets
;
they
include
high
-
yield
corporate
bonds
,
institutional
credit
products
,
emerging
market
securities
and
even
staple
commodities
,
and
this
is
going
to
be
the
next
bubble
.

However
,
I
heard
recently
that
some
contents
in
SKII
do
harm
to
the
skin
over
time
,
and
so
I
dare
not
use
any
more
after
a
second
thought
.

For
some
unknown
reason
,
when
I
was
eating
the
other
day
,
the
tooth
suddenly
ached
during
the
meal
,
and
it
was
very
painful
.

People
all
like
to
call
themselves
son
of
the
people
,
and
son
of
the
Chinese
nation
.

In
fact
,
Zhou
Enlai
best
understood
and
mastered
the
"
Concept
on
People
"
of
Mao
Zedong
Thought
,
and
best
understood
and
mastered
the
concept
of
"
The
Development
of

Society
"
of
Mao
Zedong
Thought
that
focuses

not

Even
if
the

will
be
slightly
lowered

it
is
healthier
to
drink
milk
on
empty
stomach
than
to
eat
nothing
the
whole
morning
when
there
is
no
time
for
breakfast
.

This
morning
I
went
to
the
supermarket
with
Dad
,
and
when
it
came
time
to
check
out
I
discovered
something
that
everybody
probably
knows
:
not
everybody
buys
the
same
things
.

Next
week
,
I
will
go
to
San
Jose
for
a
three
-
day
business
trip
.

Dad
shook
his
head
.

When
moving
the
chair
,
Qingqing
pushed
it
:
Some
children
in
our
class
move
chairs
just
like
that
.

Then

there
's
more
than
just

type
of

,
and
the
preparation
is
n't
always
simple
.

What
you
said
is
right
:
many
of
these
are
individual
clashes
.

Some
people
's
resulting
variables
do
not
change
,
or
there
is
only
one
value
:
clashes
.

This
should
be

the

can
give
are
always

Victory
over

Was

Before
the
war
,
China
's
air
force
had
some
300
airplanes
;
that
may
seem
like
quite
a
few
,
but
they
were
all
used
up
in
just
one
year
,
and
afterward
we
could
only
watch
as
Japanese
aircrafts
ruled
the
skies
over
China
.

In
his
memoirs
,
Li
Zongren
took
great
delight
in
talking
about
Taierzhuang
,
where
he
used
cast
-
off
troops
,
Sichuan
troops
and
Northeastern
troops
to
inflict
heavy
losses
on
the
supremely
arrogant
"
Great
Japanese
Imperial
Army
"
;
in
his
own
view
,
it
was
all
rather
inconceivable
.

The
Central
Army
,
the
Jin
Army
,
the
Sichuan
Army
,
the
Northwest
Army
,
the
Gui
Army
,
etc.
,
and
of
course
the
Eighth
Route
Army
and
the
New
Fourth
Army
,
which
until
then
had
been
implacable
enemies
,
came
together
to
rescue
the
imperiled
nation
,
and
that
was
not
an
easy
matter
.

China
's
perseverance
was
just
the
right
thing
to
strike
at
Japan
's
weak
spot
;
countries
like
Japan
have
trouble
sustaining
a
high
-
intensity
war
.

And
this
contribution
was
made
using
"
blood
and
flesh
to
build
our
new
Great
Wall

A
few
days
ago
,
another
Taiwanese

passed

There
was
no

All
of

passive
safety

had
already

carried

Qingqing
looked

Legend

I
took
the
subway
to
meet
someone
at
the
railway
station
today
and
found
a
red
header
document
posted
everywhere
inside
the

station
.

What
governmental
departments
spend
is
taxpayers
'
money
.

I
got
a
job
in
1998
;
I
first
wasted
three
years
working
in
a
public
institution
,
and
in
2001
I
began
setting
up
my
own
business
;
I
got
things
rolling
,
and
I
amassed
a
considerable
amount
.

2.
Effort
,
progress
,
and
constant
study
:

1.
What
you
pay
out
you
will
get
back
.

I
urge
everyone
to
read
the
new
book
written
by
Li
Kaifu
,
the
president
of
Google
China
;
the
book
by
Li
Jian
,
the
president
of
Pinsou
,
is
also
not
bad
.

In
other
words
,
people
ca
n't
even
treat
him
to
a
cup
of
coffee
,

In
a
crucial
period
for
the
resumption
of
the
Six
-
Party
Talks
on
the
Korean
Peninsula
nuclear
issue
,
Japanese
media
revealed
on
December
3
that
in
exchange
for
Russia
's
support
at
the
Six
-
Party
Talks
,
North
Korea
has
given
Russia
exclusive
import
rights
to
its
uranium
ore
.

Children
of
the
rich
and
government
officials
,
who
does
n't
want
to
enhance
their
status
through
overseas
study
?

I
have
n't
stepped
onto
a
court
for
a
long
time
and
I
thought
I
might
not
be
able
to
play
a
full
fifty
minutes
.

Who
believes
it
?

A
youth
in
his
20s
was
suspected
to
have
been
seriously
attacked
after
he
left
a
party
;
he
was
found
lying
in
one
of
the
apartment
units
,
and
was
pronounced
dead
upon
arrival
at
the
hospital
.

They
follow
one
of
the
world
's
common
truths
that
things
will
turn
around
when
they
become
extreme
.

Authorities
have
announced
an
indefinite
curfew
throughout
Baghdad
.

Earlier
on
,
Iran
's
involvement
with
the
Euro
-
for
-
oil
transactions
turned
out
to
be
a
big
news
item
with
negligible
after
-
effects
,
and
finally
it
became
a
non-issue
,
and
hence
there
was
no
problem
for
Iran
and
the
United
States
.

If
people
's
evil
conduct
even
befalls
such
hallowed
ground
,
then
the
hurt
it
causes
to
the
people
's
heart
and
even
the
president
can
be
easily
imagined
.

This
month
Jiangxi
Province
increased
pension
payments
to
the
retirees
,
but
all
the
indispensable
living
costs
that
a
person
needs
to
pay
for
have
started
to
rise
accordingly
in
the
markets
.

In
any
country
,
the
judiciary
ca
n't
print
money
.

Actually
I
graduated
from
elementary
school
with
very
good
grades
,
but
because
my
parents
were
not
well
connected
,
I
was
rejected
by
the
best
one
,
No.

Middle
School
.

Many
netizens
think
that
Yuan
Longping
's
repeated
winning
of
major
international
awards
shows
international
approval
and
praise
for
the
great
contribution
in
research
and
promotion
aspects
of
hybrid
rice
made
by
those
,
represented
by
him
,
working
in
rice
breeding
in
China
over
many
years
.

According
to
sources
,
in
Henan
Province
where
the
Xinliang
Group
is
located
,
the
first
sale
of
temporary
grain
reserves
only
began
last
week
.

Just
those
couple
of
last
night
's
World
Cup
games
were
such
and
so
forth
.

Long
ago
,
his
life
was
proven
to
be
all
for
world
peace
,
all
for
the
people
having
peaceful
and
happy
lives
.

If
I
still
do
n't
write
anything
,
I
will
feel
even
sorry
for
myself
.

They
have
expelled
each
others
'
diplomats
and
closed
their
embassies
.

For
more
than
100
days
,
more
than
thirty
migrant
workers
at
Binhai
Park
in
the
city
of
Haikou
have
been
trying
to
collect
their
wages
owed
by
the
park
,
which
is
in
arrears
to
them
for
sixteen
months
of
wages
totaling
more
than
400,000
yuan
.

I
have
gone
for
numerous
recruitment
interviews
for
the
foreign
-
funded
banks
in
the
past
few
years
,
and
also
have
had
some
contacts
with
foreign
-
funded
banks
.

Song
Jiang
's
uprising
was
not
that
awe
-
inspiring
.

Calculated
this
way
,
in
recent
years
our
country
has
to
take
in
more
than
70
%
of
the
electronic
trash
in
the
whole
world
annually
.

I
,
as
a
person
,
do
n't
have
much
ambition
,
so
when
I
listen
to
music
,
the
best
is
purely
to
get
away
from
reality
,
stuff
like
Utopia
,
the
Garden
of
Eden
,
fantasy
or
sweet
nothings
is
just
fine
.

The
first
time
when
I
cooked
rice
on
a
clay
stove
as
a
kid
,
I
burned
it
into
a
potful
of
charcoal
.

When
Xu
Xin
first
invested
in
Ding
Lei
of
Netease
,
he
was
the
first
one
to
enter
the
SMS
business
and
the
first
one
to
develop
online
games
.

On
the
4th
day
of
the
matches
,
Internazionale
Milan
would
be
in
freezing
-
cold
Moscow
;
Spartak
is
the
only
team
that
uses
artificial
turf
,
and
it
will
be
a
great
test
for
the
Internazionale
Milan
.

The
first
characteristic
seized
by
this
fellow
was
that
"
yesterday
was
the
28th
anniversary
of
the
death
of
Mao
Zedong
,
the
founder
of
Communist
China
,
but
in
official
Chinese
media
,
including
television
,
newspapers
,
and
websites
,
there
were
hardly
any
reports
commemorating
Mao
.

But
,
after
all
,
China
and
North
Korea
are
not
enemies
and
it
is
still
possible
to
cross
over
if
you
talk
to
the
North
Korean
border
guards
.

Each
time
September
9
comes
around
,
they
unaccountably
fix
their
gaze
on
the
"
trend
"
in
"
China
's
official
media
"
and
then
make
a
fuss
over
it
,

Even
within
Italy
,
their
records
are
quite
far
behind
Juventus
and
AC
.

Because
Darwin
was
allowed
to
make
mistakes
,
since
he
was
a
human
being
;
but
Jesus
was
not
allowed
to
make
mistakes
,
since
he
had
been
described
as
God
.

I
was
so
desperate
,
acting
out
Romeo
's
struggle
before
he
stabbed
himself
with
a
dagger
,
calling
out
in
my
heart
:
money
,
money
,
money
,
though
what
came
out
of
my
mouth
was
Juliet

name
.

"
The
family
of
Jia
Chunhua
's
elder
sister
is
taking
special
care
of
me
,
cooking
my
dinner
every
day
.

Subsequently
,
it
is
that
small
man
who
is
"
threatening
"
the
"
security
"
of
the
large
man
?!

The
ordinary
people
were
left
only
with
"
reform
"
,
while
the
"
elite
"
who
constituted
less
than
10
%
of
China
held
more
than
90
%
of
the
wealth
.

During
delivery
,
it
takes
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
if
it
is
a
natural
birth
,

The
US
helped
the
opposing
forces
to
deal
with
what
they
called
"
a
communist
revolution
.

Thus

there

Ten

Most
of

time
people
who
have
gone
through
harsh
experiences
say
that
they
have
gained
from
their
experiences
and
have
become
better
people
,
their
personality
has
grown
stronger
and
their
feelings
have
grown
stronger
as
well
as
their
confidence
in
themselves

about
Al

his
readiness

raises
a

about
why
this

considers
the
execution

that
refuses
to
respect
the

of

in

out
the
execution
on

Your

does
not
honor
any

state
by
having
relations
with
it
...

We
are
on
the
verge
of
destruction
and
ruin
,
very
close
in
Iraq
,
incomparable
to
what
happened
to
it
in
previous
years

The
bitter
truth
is
that
..
this

came
through
a
forged
legitimate
way
..
whose
mask
will
be
revealed
in
the

A
medical
source
at

in

told
United

International
that
Palestinian
citizen
Kamal
Mohamed
Al

-LRB-
33
years

died
shortly
after

by

on

two

Are
these
the
values
of
Arabism

decency
,
and
pride
?

Those
who
carried
out
the
death
sentence
do
not
want
reconciliation
or
to
maintain
a

.

This
cartoonist
supported
the
issue
with
his
brush
and
depicted
how
danger
lurks
if
it
is
endorsed
.

What
is
your
opinion
about
women
driving
cars
?

Do
you
thank
them
as
I
do
?

But
some
explained
his
Islamic
tendency
by
saying
that
he
was
currying
favor
with
the
Sunnis
as
if
they
were
reading
his
mind
.

I
believe
that
this
could
n't
have
happened
without
God
making
him
steadfast
otherwise
God
would
not
have
made
him
steadfast
in
it

I

the

surrounding

to

with

A

I
was

.

2.
Lack

gave
us
an

for

It
was
revealed
that
the

were
returned
to

And
that
he
justified
his
refusal
of
the
previous
instruction
on
the
invalidity
of
the
decision
of
dismissal
which
was
according
to
the
instruction
of
the

and
his
insistence
on
my
dismissal
.

The
case
apparently
--
God

--
involves
a
biiiiiiiiig
head

May
God
have
mercy
on
him

We
should
not
utter
the

of

for
anyone
who
we
felt

towards
or
who
we
sympathized

Where
is
the

This
is
because
those
for

ending
has
already
been
decreed
by

in

to

There

of

and
holding

with
a

looking
for

..

All
this
in
consultation
with
Hamas
in
Syria
and
Palestine
so
as
to
bring
views
closer
..

He
said
that
Israel
does
not
have
a
problem
with
Iran
but
that
they
are
against
Ahmadinejad
because
of
his
desire
to
eradicate

How
many
did
Peres
kill

how
many
did

You
describe
the
contemporary
Qatari
situation
as
just
a
legitimate
quest
for
scientific
and
technological
superiority
..

There
is
no
room
for
leaving
the
door
wide
open
for
discussing
or
teaching
"
science
and
technology
"
as
the
theory
of
development
..
or
the
theories
of
Darwin
..
or
how
to
make
bombs
or
liquor
..
or
the
creeds
of
polytheism
or
excessiveness
in
regarding
others
as
unbelievers
..
or
the
sciences
of
judging
with
anything
other
than
the
revelations
of
God

except
by
the
way
of
warning
against
them

Greetings

Neither
Al

Arabiya
nor
Al

I
left
the
place
to
catch
them
,
and
get
their
license
plate
numbers
.

It
turned
out
to
be
stolen
.
"

I
saw
what
is
happening
with
my
own
eyes
,
so
what
do
you
think
of
a
big
city
like
the
city
of
Riyadh
?

7-
robbing
the
house
of
laborers
we
know
and
assaulting
them
,

If
public
punishments
are
not
applied
,
the
situation
will
remain
the
same
,
and
the
rest
will
not
be
deterred
.

At
the
same
time
,
it
is
a
warning
to
anyone
who
considers
doing
this
that
judicial
punishment
will
be
his
destiny
.

As
for
crimes
,
they
are
many
.

I
went
back
home
as
an
unknown
with
a
copy
of
the
identification
;
I
spent
a
week
on
the
road
to
pass
,
and
all
who
saw
me
empty
-
pocketed
said
stop
in
your
place
.

The
young
people
were
happy
.

We
are
a
people
most
intimidated
should
a
missile
or
heavy
5
-
ton
bombs
fall
near
us
.

And
the
means
of
criminality
were
provided
by
our
rational
country
,
until
the
criminals
became
holders
of
scientific
and
mechanical
degrees
.

The
statements
of
this
man
since
he
was
in
his
post
,
were
strong
and
clear
,
containing
neither
fear
nor
sycophancy
.

However
,
the
government
seems
subject
to
the
United
States
'
dictates
that
have
expressed
in
various
ways
its
insistence
on
handing
over
the
Iraqi
oil
resources
to
foreign
companies
as
one
of
the
main
aims
of
the
Occupation
.

Foreign
companies
can
come
and
go
without
any
advanced
technology
establishing
itself
in
the
country
.

and
this
too
will
not
lead
to
equity
,
nor
to
development
and
attaining
public
interest
.

The
grandstand
of
Saudi
Arabia
was
crowded
with
Thai
girls
,
maybe
some
of
them
were
Saudi
!

But
Jasir
al
-
Jasir
,
the
writer
for
the
newspaper
Shams
,
refused
to
do
anything
other
than
make
fools
out
of
us
by
insisting
that
they
are
Saudis
.

What
burns
the
heart
is
the
eagerness
of
some
cultured
people
and
writers
to
harm
their
country
whether
they
are
aware
or
unaware
?

you

tried

acquire
weapons
of

practiced
dictatorship
over

so
it
was
only
natural
that
we
extended
our
hand
to
the
people
of

to
rid
them
of
the
perils
which
had
confronted
them
for
more

you

the

his

the

of
re-evaluating
our
position
on
you
and
on
the
many
forces
which
displayed
hostility
to
us
in
the
past
.

I
refused
and
I
repeat
the
refusal
once
again
.

I
warned
you
in
advance
when
I
said
to
you
that
you
will
commit
suicide
on
the

,
and
here
you
are
paying
the
price

as
it
claims
,
why
did
it
give
the
green
light
to
its
agents
and
militias
in
Iraq
to
execute
Saddam
Hussein
on
Eid
Al
Adha
and
provide
justifications
on
a
golden
plate
for
those
who
want
to
break
down
Muslims
on
a
sectarian
basis
?

No
,
the
public
support
for
Hezbollah
has
even
turned
into
a
tremendous
indignation
from
Iran
and
its
allies
in
the
Arab
region
.

Then
His
Excellency
was
asked
about
the
execution
of
the
former
Iraqi
president
,
Saddam
Hussein

I
acknowledge
his
manliness
,
his
steadfastness
and
his
courage
in
going
to
the
gallows
and
his
response
to
those
around
him
.

For
what
I
see
and
believe
is
that
there
is
in
what
I
said
profit
-
by
God
's
leave
-
in
the
two
worlds
.

The
Arabized
Arabs

Sari
Al
-
Hamad

This
is
a
first
and
last
point
of
view
...

But
fifth
columnists
and
the
allies
of
foreign
embassies
who
get
paid
in
dollars
by
western
organizations
have
an
agenda
and
jobs
they
must
do
.

Ihsas2

I
do
not
think
that
there
is
one
Muslim
who
accepts
the
verdict
of
the
Supreme
Court
because
it
is
a
racist
verdict
and
blatant
interference
between
a
husband
and
his
wife
for
trivial
reasons
.

Sarah
al
-
Hamad

/

Sahar
Mohamed
Al
Baqtarsi
-
35
years
old
-
died
,
suffering
a
sudden
heart
attack
from
the
horrendousness
of
the
surprise
.

and
an-
her
her
comments
were
that
the
commentators
seem
pretty
high
on
the
Skins

No

oh
We
have
to
go
talk
for
a
half
an
hour

I
thought
it
was
a
long
time
ago
Playboy

%hm

very
foolish
girl

Well
what
was
it
no
well
what
was

no

I
had
to
leave
on
Sunday

yeah

actually
We
're
having
trouble
Now
all
the
places
are
full
because
like
Amy
ha-
was
wait
listed
I
was
wait
listed
to
get
to
Japan

I
called
every
airline
as
you
know
only
I
can
do

can
you
at
least
go
business
class

well
that
's
they
were
actually
they
were
going
to
send
me
on
T
W
A

It
's
not
that
bad
by
the
time
you
slept

maybe
I
'll
find
out
how
much
more
I
have
to
pay

but
I
have
a
feeling
it
's
like
a
price
thing

uh-huh
.

but
she
would
n't
let
go
of
me
when
we
got
in
the
water

And
I
did
n't
really
want
to
see
anybody
for
a
while
.

%ah

That
's
good
.

And
it
was
from
Lodz
.

I
've
been
smoking
big
time
.

yeah
.

She
's
going
to
be
happy
that
I
heard

Well
I
think
,

so
I
I
would
like
to
think
that
it
goes
to
a
good

I
'll
have
to
think
of
it
.

See
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
'm
going
to
be
here
.

But
then
you
might
come
back
to
the
states
or
something
.

I
mean
I
,
I
do
n't
know
.

and
people
do
n't
have
any
air
and
ec-
electricity

because
last
time
I
heard
it
was
two
hundred
and
sixty
-
two
or
something
like
that

%um
no
like
two
-
way
phone

oh
here
it
is
Priority
Party
Call

yeah
.

Maybe
make
it
,
make
Japan
the
last
place
.

%um
,
and
now
we
're
getting
a
few
graduates
going
back
uh-huh
.
that
graduated
this
year
.

Whenever
.

I
have
n't
talked
to
them
yet
to
see
where
they
would
be
Now
,
they
're
interested
or
just
what
?
what
they
're
thinking
about
.

mhm

oh
dear
.

you
know
his
aunt
and
uncle
live
here
yeah
,
I
know
mhm
in
town

yeah

oh
that
's
good

%um
he
said
that
Is-
Israel
is
such
a
highly
I
knew
that
I
do
n't
know
I
technical
%uh
advanced
technical
country
that
if
there
's
something
good
they
're
going
to
use
it

I
did
n't
even
know
that
here

Well
a
lot
of
people
do
n't
eat
meat
anymore
because
of
you
know
all
these
objections
and
all

oh
yeah

so
everything
you
kn-

he
does
a
wonderful
job

oh
wow
I
do
n't
know
where
they
got
that
idea
from

yes

yeah

I
'm
sorry

yeah

yeah

yeah

and
and
or
or
just
about
the
time
you
were
born
they
left
Hudson

oh
I
did
n't
know
any
of
this

yeah

right

they
were
always
th-

yeah

no
that
was
Paula
was
the
fat
one

that
's
right
near
Hudson

I
do
n't
know
her
either

It
's
not
worth
it

%huh

but
I
still
have
that

I
remember
you
said
last
time
that
the
doctor
said
that
you
had
to
have
a
baby
because
of
your
your
ovaries
or
whatever
just
to
keep
everything
in
order

I
hope
I
hope
I
never
have
to
deal
with
endometriosis
again

h-
That
's
Logan
Andres

well
we
're
still
married

But
it
really

No
,

yeah

but
they
wanted
to
live
in
an
apartment
.

oh
yes
.

but
that
did
influence
a
little
bit
.

okay

oh
good

Did
%um
did
the
outdoor
pictures
come
out
fuzzy
?

and
also
I
think
the
sunnier
the
more
bright
the
sun
is
the
fuzzier
it
comes
out
for
some
reason
.

today
she
Excuse
me
.
Today
she
colored
up
the
walls
.

she
I
see
that
she
's
beginning
to
she
takes
the
knowledge
that
she
picks
up
in
one
place
and
she
applies
it
in
another
place
.

%eh
she
started
saying
whenever
I
would
ask
her
where
's
Sarah
's
bottle
I
do
n't
know

that
's
your
job
?

I
told
you
about
that
shampoo

I
also
have
yeah
I
also
have

I
I
sometimes
feel
like
I
you
know
I
I
want
to
keep
it
under
control
but
to
make
sure
that
every
%eh
d-
l-
you
know
down
to
the
last
is
gone

okay

yeah

just
for
my
pictures
I
'm
concerned
about

uh-huh

but
then
they
're
also
enjoying
it
.

if
they
have
like
a
two
-
tiered
one
yeah
because
that
would
save
a
lot
of
space

yeah

she
has

Mindy
my
sister
-
in
-
law
Mindy
when
Sarah
was
born
gave
me
a
very
nice
blue
yeah
uh-huh
standard
I
think
it
's
Osh
Kosh
stuff
g-
%um
jumper

I
was
saying
if
you
do
n't
see
any
sisters
in
sight
so
you
could
you
know

%eh
it
's
for
educational
purposes
.

I
thought
you
you
know
it
's
a
good
hat
man
.

Really
?

uh-huh
.

Wait
a
minute

So

yeah

yeah

We
enjoy
it
.

Do
n't
believe
them
.

the

%uh
y-
you
could
buy

That
's
not
so
bad
.

You
should
feel
comfortable
staying
there
,

Like
wearing
one
dress
.

and
we
have
a
nice
young
Jewish
legislator
who
is
%uh
going
to
put
in
a
bill
for
us
this
year
.

so
I
've
got
that
.

yeah
.

and
they
invited
in
most
of
their
old
friends

Eighty
.

And
she
's
a
nurse

either
five
or
six

she

right

right
right
.

Right
.

mhm
.

their
daughter
is
Linda

you
never
send
me
an
address
or
a
telephone
number

The
thing
about
it
is
the
city
is
so
beautiful

we
like
you

and
so
he
he
always
invites
%um
like
%ah
invites
about
twelve
students
over
at
a
time
you
know
and
he
'd
and
%uh
ha-
invites
them
over
for
dinner
at
his
house

you
can
eat
em

is
it
just
of
the
center
?

and
then
and
then
there
's
a
patio
where
you
go
outside

we
go
there
a
lot

I
guess
I
was
an
hour
off

I
love
it

I
said
Near
Eastern
Civilizations

and
%ah
tha-
that
's
been
interesting
to
to
learn
about

he
's
known
as
a
dry
Mormon
down
here

you
you
really
do

You
see
?

That
's
the
purpose
.

Right
.

that
's
the

%uh
,
you
know
the
other
thing
is

Well
I
can
probably
change
it
.

%um

The
important
thing
is
that
we
have
it
.

%um

But
it
's
not
a
problem
.

It
's
,
it
's
great
.

So
they
'll
probably
want
to
go
with
us
this
year
.

It
may
not
happen
.

You
mean
,
do
n't
you
well
,
you
carry
multiple
calendars
,
so
you
never
know
?

And
,
so
,
since
I
did
n't
go
to
their
wedding
,
I
I
--
feeling
this
big
pressure
.

So
I
thought
I
could
get
a
ticket
.

because
I
've
seen
a
map
.

Does
that
mean
I
have
to
get

But

Abendgarderobe
.

Pardon
?

No
%uh
,
spring
chicken

so

And
then
I
'll
go
Monday
--
down
to
Bonn
,
or
wherever
my
those
relatives
are
because
I
have
n't
seen
my
uncle
in
like
three
or
four
years
,
and
he
's
just
turning
eighty
and
I
like
them
a
lot

yeah
.

that
's
for
sure
.

And
what
's
,
what
I
had
mentioned
about
my
mother
bugging
me
was
the
fact
that
every
time
I
see
her
or
we
even
talk
,
she
has
to
comment
about
my
clothes
,
or
what
I
'm
wearing
.

I
'm
pretty
tough
.

and
it
was
like
thirty
mile
an
hour
wind

yeah

so
.

Wow
.

so
but
seriously
like
email
this
to
everybody
you
know
.

I
know

but
I
did
n't
get
up
early
because
I
was
tired
,

All
you
hear
were
we
have
lots
of
computers

%hm

But
she
wants
to
go
out
with
me

I
've
onl-
only
read
three
pages
of
the
sixty
I
have
to
read
.

and
Joanna
Nichols
is
insisting
that
I
take
this
independent
study
with
her

but
the
thing
is
I
did
n't
hear
it
because
Eric
heard
it
in
the
car
and
he
called
me
at
work
and
left
a
message
but
Darren
was
on
the
line
.

I
'm
only
stressed
this
weekend
because
I
have
all
like
I
have
party
and
I
have
Diana
and
I
had
to
finish
up
that
book
review
for
Language
Magazine

and
then
you
pay
an
additional
little
fee
.

He
said
they
might
be
moving
.

I
think
this
is
a
really
bad
connection
because
,
there
's
a
d-
there
's
a
little
bit
of
a
lag
.

What
do
you
,
do
y-
you
go
through
a
,
like
a
n-
three
monthly
cycle
or
something
.

but
I
am
so
isolated
.

But
,
I
do
n't
know
what
the
secret
is
of
cracking
the
code
.
You
know
.

oh
,
no
.

and
that
was
really
good
you
know
.

I
mean
,
it
's
like
it
comes
off
the
North
Sea
and
knocks
you
on
your
ass
.

It
's
a
little
bit
on
,
it
's
a
little
bit
d-
south
from
here
uh-huh
.
and
on
the
east
coast
,

Not
not
too
bad
,

and
%um
,
and
two
Libyan
guys
.

Ascher
,

interesting

mhm
.

and
the
ministry
of
education
has
approved
it
so
it
will
be
available
if

She
has
done
such
wonderful
work
,
Ida
.
--

She
's
been
to
Savannah

So
it
became
a
book

A
hundred
people
are
wounded
and
seven
dead
.

Well
,
has
n't
it
divided
the
country
?

Gaza
does
n't
come
under
this
thing
.

Well
he
has
to
continue
.

Well
I
'm
very
mad
with
Golda
because
she
refused
to
do
it
.

you
never
know
the
game
.

I
believe
in
the
people
Ida
.

%hm
.

I
I
should
have
done
it
.

You
know
I
had
a
a
student

It
's
the
old
story
.

But
the
problem
with
this
stuff
is
Ida
that
after
a
while
your
body
gets
used
to
it
,

And
he
changed
me
to
the
Airobid

yeah
.

but
you
know
it
's
like
that
's
no
answer
either

I
figure
my
body
is
a
very
slow
%um
yeah
**maturer**

No

we
're
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it

you
enjoyed
your
food

but
I
mean
you
mind
as
well
think
of
them
in
a
negative
vie-
rather
than

mhm
.

I
mean
i-
it
's
like
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
there
's
like
no
pleasure
that
's
as
intense
as
the
one
that
you
are
experiencing
at
that
moment
you
know

in
that
nasty
sterile
office
where
the
windows
do
n't
even
open
--

I
'm
like
dying
to
go
there

Is
the
one
over
in
Gracia
that

mhm

But
I
did
n't
say
I
I
just
thought
that
you
know
I
'll
get
a
job

And
you
could
Well
and
you
can
always
go
back
to
that
if
you
wanted
to
you
know
working
at
least
in
the
States

yeah

Get
thy
ass
on
the
table
.

But
this
guy
supposedly
is
a
retired
Marine
pilot
.

I
know
,

Well
your
tour
is
what
three
years
,
Ker
,

So
the
only
other
choice
they
gave
me
was
either
,
%uh
,
Great
Mistakes
mhm
or
Twenty
Nine
Palms
.

No
,
no
,
%uh
%uh
.

oh
man
.

and
that
was
Barney
.

it
was
it
was
a
real
surprise
to
hear
,

I
did
n't
even
have
to
look
,
you
know
,
because
I
knew
that
both
Barney
and
I
were
,
%um
,
eligible
.
mhm
Not
in
zone
but
eligible
.

And
then
,
%uh
,
after
the
whole
episode
called
her
back
later
,

yeah

Does
he
know
that
I
live
all
the
way
here
now
?

I
want
black
velvet
okay
backdrop

yeah
,

okay
.

so
,
if
yo-
,
if
you
know
,

How
many
rolls
did
you
tell
him
?

and
mhm
all
of
that
can
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time

I
,
%um
,
i-

yeah
,
right
directly
across
the
street

the
Holiday
Inn
man
that
sounded
cr-
yucky
was
%um
area
was
ninety
nine
dollars
for
a
double
,
without
a
continental
breakfast
,
and
a
hundred
and
fourteen
dollars
with
the
continental
breakfast
,

no
,

Reserve

yeah

uh-huh

and
she
just
kept
staring
at
me
,

yeah

%um
,
no
,

it
's
kind
of
a

uh-uh
.

I
wanted
to
see
this
mov-
,
Species
movie
which
was
pretty
good
.

I
just
think
you
're
getting
a
little
worked
up
about
th-

I
e-
w-
I
do
n't
know
if
you
asked
me
.

all
he
d-
,

I
will
,
I
'll
act
abrupt
then
also
,

And
,
and
I
was
saying

that
's
kind
of
my
,
you
know
.

Never
mind
,

I
just

I
think
that

I
I
I
'm
I
'm
to-
totally
insist
on
it
.

And
I
'm
kind
of
thinking
about
saying
,
well
here
's
here
give
me
a
couple
of
bucks
,

Well
,
I
think
that
that
would
be
reasonable
.

yeah
partially

he
's
much
sweeter

yeah
,

yeah
,

I
ca
n't
imagine
how
hot
it
would
be
.

yeah
,

Alexia
are
you
okay
?

well
we
spoke
in
English
,

so
,
it
's
like

,
no
it
's
a
Finnish
station
.

Frank
Lloyd
Wright
's
%huh
?

it
would
have
been
nice
to
see
.

well
,
it
's
especially
for
--

sorry

okay

mhm
smallest
class
in
the
school
.

Tammy
you
almost
wo
n't
know
what
to
do
with
yourself

mhm

He
spends
his
he
's
been
there
twenty
-
five
years
they
say

In
the
classroom
yes
as
far
as
I
know
.

she
was
she
had
welts
all
over
her
whole
legs

but
that
's
a
long
time
incubating

oh
.

I
had
a
I
was
in
a
patient
's
home
once

and
%uh
then
in
the
evenings
my
mom
and
I
linked
up
together

oh
good
.

so

oh
mhm
mhm

but
in
fact
the
one
of
the
fellows
is
talking
about
this
player
whom
I
never
heard
of
you
know
and
how
proud
they
are
of
him
and
everybody

but
%uh
Well
maybe
they
'll
get
back
up
there
mhm
they
really
get
into
these
slumps

how
did
you
see
Annette
today
?

I
mean
you
know
each
one
is
counteracting
the
other

she
told
me
that
.

I
said
well
I
said
I
'm
in
pretty
good
shape
.

hopefully

What
is
he
going
to
do

he
does
n't
eat
a
thing
ever

until
I
made
the
decision
I
was
scared
and
also
utz

n-
the
not
the
Israeli
guy
not
the
Sephardic
guy
but
No
you
're
kidding
that
kind
of
Well
then
that
happened
fast
because
that
that
little
feminine
kind
of
guy

but
the
wor-
the
worst
thing
was
originally
when
she
came
to
her
parents
and
she
was
going
to
get
married
she
was
going
to
get
married
in
October

and
we
rented
beautiful
china
and
silverware
and
glasses

so
that
's
not
so
long

so
on
one
hand
I
understand
them

where
is
she
living

but
not
only
that

and
we
put
out
the
salads
and
the
meats
and
the
all
different
kinds
that

wow

and
she
was
really
upset

but
does
n't
she
have
a
son
who
's
older

And
,
%uh

So
you
have
no
intentions
of
coming
over
this
way
any
time
soon
?

and
I
'm
actually
presently
working
on
,
%um
,
several
,
%uh
,
articles
oh
,
okay
.
Impressive
.
from
it
.

okay
.

So
,
so
,
so
you
,
you-
,
you
're
pushing
forward
the
bounds
of
theoretical
laser
laser
,
%uh
,
whatever
it
is
science
.

And
what
's
actually
kind
of
interesting
is
I
kept
telling
Neil
that
I
thought
that
this
was
kind
of
significant
.

Yes
.

The
first
time
they
broke
in
,
they
what
they
stole
was
just
bizarre
,

And
so
%uh
,
that
's
yeah
at
least
dealt
with
.

and
%um
so
I
worked
in
the
office
for
a
week
in
a
half

and
we
came
we
came
back
to
Detroit

What
's
your
area
then
?

then
I
go
to
Des
Moines

so
I
thought
that
would
work
out

but
%uh
he
'd
he
had
strep
throat
when
I
was
here

I
do
n't
know
what
I
was
thinking

yeah

I
'm
I
just
was
still
unsure
about
it

I
'm
fine

uh-huh
.

I
said
I
I
think
maybe
we
need
the
we
need
the
time
just
to
kind
of
figure
out
where
our
relationship
is
before

but
in
other
ways
it
's
like
this
is
a
whole
new
relationship

and

so
I
'll
have

but
I
've
got
so
much
more
going
for
me
than
she
does
.
I
know
.
You
know
in
the
in
the
larger
scheme
.

and
I
wo
n't
want
to
do
it
.

uh-huh
.

I
should
really
use
those
should
n't
I
?

That
's
like
critical
for
us
.

I
ca
n't
i-
I
was
so
tense

and
I
had
I
they
kept
telling
me
I
did
n't
need
to
rent
a
car
which
I
absolutely
did
.

uh-huh
.

So
like
they
ca
n't
say
to
Joel
look
you
know
go
away
for
a
while

I
mean
it
was
it
was
just
painful

I
mean
it
was
all
just
in
you
know
just
ridiculous
.

uh-huh

pretty
good

You
have
to
record
write
up
journal
write
-
ups

oh
you
're
kidding
.

I
had
to
use
up
my
last
two
vacation
days
because
I
had
they
make
you
do
that
now
for
some
reason
--
--
which
is
fairly
new
which
really
is
n't
fair

and

That
's
the
only
way
I
can
study
.

So
I
figured
we
'd
%um
--
--
take
more
time
give
him
some
more
time
and
like
evaluate
in
like
six
months
like
in
October
.

or
that
should
show
you
--
--
you
know

uh-huh
.

Right
.

yeah
.

I
've
heard
of
him
--

I
really

yeah
,

Wow
.

yeah

but
he
's
black

and

you
did
,

oh
.

what
does
pep
mean
?

and
I
'm
like
hi
.

%um
,
you
have
a
picture
of
me

yeah

%um
,
oh
wel-
,

because
we
're
being
recorded
.

oh
by
the
way
,
when
you
do
%um
,
words
that
begin
with
like
a
vowel
?
you
do
n't
like
change
it

they
they
they
were
like
oh
I
want
to
name
it
dad
.

yeah
.

when
is
that
?

psychology

%hm
,
pep
,

okay

Mary
?

oh
my
god
,
I
wore
like
a
new
pair
of
shoes
yesterday

I
know

I
kind
of
assumed
everyone
would
be
at
the
shore
.

But
%uh

%mm
%mm
.

That
's
too
bad
.

yeah
.

And
when
he
goes
to
work
he
brings
four
sandwiches
with
him
,
uh-huh
.
a
bag
of
potato
chips
uh-huh
.
%um
and
you
know
and
then
little
sweetie
things
chocolates
and
**cakies**
and
stuff
like
that
.

yeah
.

Exactly
.

Could
you
do
that
?

You
can
just
leave
a
message
.

What
?

To
the
--
--
you
know
the
other
thing
,
the
reception
.

%mm
,
my
goodness
.

%huh
how
fun-
.

Of
course
I
'm
talking
to
you
.

And
he
kind
of
,
he
just
keeps
forgetting
.

It
's
a
two
person
job
though
.

it
's
about
a
hundred
K's
from
here
.

I
'll
tell
you
what
's
happening

Did
you
know
he
just
had
a
bypass
?

well
we
played
some
tennis

I
know
it
,

he
makes
all
those
trips
.

mhm

and
it
finally
happened

and
then
of
course
in
May
to
celebrate
my
birthday
we
brought
in
Charlie
Mariano

Well
yeah

The
ones
you
recorded
with
Al
Cone
and
all
of
that
.

%hm

yeah

with
Conti
we
did
n't
even
have
time
for
a
re-
one
rehearsal
not
even

Wow
.

He
's
actually
going
to
play
with
us
in
Murenau
some
town
near
here
on
November
thirtieth

mhm
.

She
came
out
,
you
know
,
a
couple
times
during
the
day

y-
,
yeah
,

%um
,
and
the
doctor
showed
up
around
three

uh-huh
.

right
away
there
,
there
was
a
very
nice
%um
delivery
nurse
who
we
had
spoken
to
earlier
in
the
day
named
Tina
.

uh-huh
.

uh-huh
.

I
think
babies
like
that
.

But
I
was
kind
of
scared
at
that
point
because
we
're
looking
in
and
there
're
all
these
nice
sweet
little
pale
babies
lying
there
limp

and
I
thought
oh
my
god
what
have
we
wrought
here
.

but
they
did
n't
tell
us
beans
.

Right
.

yeah
.

I
do
n't
know

I
hope
you

It
's
going
to
be
thirty
minutes
in
about
five
minutes
I
think
.

so
I
could
n't
tell

but
it
's
not
so
popular
here
in
France
.

oh
neat
.

mhm
.
mhm
.

%huh
?

mhm
.

You
would
.

%huh
?

yeah
.

shower
today
.

But
I
made
an
appointment
for
seven
.

Are
you
going
to
camp
?

So
.
I
do
n't

No
.

I
do
n't
think
you
'll
have
to
.

yeah

You
'll
just
say
okay
,

or
we
could
take
a
bus
mhm
.
both
ways
.

I
'm
out
of
the
doghouse
.

You
said
something
really
funny
.

like
halfway
across
the
scr-

mom
wanted
to
see
you
with
edit

some
.

I
'm
landing
at
five
in
the
morning
.

is
that
the
one
who
who
who
is
it
that
lived
in
Jerusalem
?

well
no
I

and
right
now
I
've
got
a
flight
that
I
'm
coming
in
like
ten
or
eleven
in
the
morning
something
like
that
.

oh

do
you
know
?

I
think
she
was
in
touch
with
l-

yeah
.

I
'm
only
leaving
my
messages
and
collecting
mine

yeah

oh
here
's
his
oh
here
's
his
new
one
.

yeah
?

mhm
.

%um
,
Lori
,
I
'm
trying
to
figure
out
my
plans
.

yeah
,

And
the
woman
made
it
sound
so
promising

That
's
a
shame

And
I
had
n't
heard
back
from
them

I
have
a
friend
in
Spain
and
a
friend
in
France
and
a
and
a
friend
in
Germany

%mm
.

Give
you
a
nice
break
.

Really
?

You
know
your
sister
was
%uh
in
Illinois
recently
.

He
did
n't
take
her
back

Then
you
know
what
she
said
to
me
?

Well
I
Good
for
you
.
I
have
to
tell
you

Good
for
you
.

She
%uh
does
n't
,
did
n't
like
what
you
s-
you
had
to
say
to
her
.

Exactly
.

I
said
I
thought
we
'd
already
been
through
this
cause
I
already
told
them
I
did
n't
want
to
go
to
Des
M-AMP-oines
.

Well
no
it
's
not
punishing
.

Dad

well
I
would
n't
keep
this

have
you
been
have
you
been
watering
the
plants
by
the
way
like
along
the
way
because
I
know
that
she
never
went
in
anymore

You
're
a
big
spoil

you
do
n't
have
to
put
that
you
do
n't
have
to
give
that
to
Lilly
anymore
if
the
fleas
are
gone

and
I
was
like
saying
like
did
n't
you
ever
clean
the
place
.
you
know

but
I
'm
going
to
take
them
all
out

yeah

He
's
he
's
getting
like
%um
mhm
getting
a
little
bit
tired
of
being
here
because
like
it
's
so
hard
to
%um
break
into
the
scene

You
know
it
jus-
it
's
it
's
it
's
you
know
it
's
just
totally
natural
,
probably
because
I
have
my
own
place
,

and
%um

yeah

No

Now
your
name
is
listed
in
in
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art

She
's
fucking
got
my
chair
completely

she
's
very
playful

mhm
.

Do
n't
I
need
to
be
professional
?

So
I
do
n't
know
.

Show
off
le
bebe
.

And
they
do
n't
need
toys
.

No
.

I
think
so
too
.

okay
.

I
mean
you
know
what
Norm
and
I
are
like

it
's
disgusting
or
obscene
or
something
.

okay

once
you
,
once
he
was
getting
bigger
or
something
there
was

I
know

and
then
there
was
this
friend
I
had

this
woman
must
be
on
just
you
know
absolute
.
pins
and
needles
.

and
it
has
helped
with
all
my
little
aches
and
pains
and
stuff
.

I
ca
n't
possibly
tell
.

Because
I
do
n't
think
that
that
would
be
warranted
--
--
at
at
at
the
salary
that
they
're
giving
you
.

I
just
do
n't
want
it
.

And
I
remember
Mama
Sadie
was
upset
about
it
.

I
find
it
very
sad
.

Well
what
about
the
job
things
?

That
's
where
I
want
to
fly
.

It
's
it
's
recycling

It
's
not
rational
.

Like
maybe
if
I
were
a
teacher
then
I
would
Everybody
always
you
know
and
I
taught
say
health
,
science
and
art
,
then
I
would
sort
of
get
this
body
of
knowledge
that
I
would
have
and
this
--
Lizzy
--
structure
to
it
.

Again
?

Really
?

They
seemed
surprised
that
,

Well
did
she
come
home
and
say
I
saw
her
,
I
look
like
her
or
what
?

That
we
were
abusing
,

She
said
Alita
she
said
this
little
girl
has
a
serious
problem
.

I
,
I
have
no
idea
.

And
they
're
twelve
and
,

yup
.

I
feel
very
at
peace
you
know
.

She
talked
to
mom
for
two
hou-
here
in
Rochester
.

She
said
she
was
going
to
call
you
.

yup
.

she
she
,

Well
pretty
well
.

but
she
was
in
a
place
called
Taiwa
.

Well
the
relative
scene
is
kind
of
sad
.

It
's
just
,
%uh
,
people
get
sick
,

No
,
she
's
been
,
she
was
not
doing
well
.

I
have
to
go
next
week
to
see
,
check
out
,
you
know
to
see
again
.

and
at
the
moment
I
'm
a
little
,
%um
,
not
quite
so
sure
.

Anyway
they
take
liqu-
,
%uh
fluid
out
of
it
.

and
we
had
a
big
trip
up
there
and
did
a
lot
of
,
a
lot
of
walking
,
a
lot
of
fast
walking
and
stuff
.

and
his
wife
just
had
their
fourth
child
.

yeah
.

and
she
thinks
it
's
the
affiliation
.

And
he

Right
.

yeah
.

Good
.

My
other
friend
just
moved
to
trade
publishing
after
years
in
academic
publishing

oh
good
.

we
moved
here
.

We
'd
been
praying
for
years
what
we
were
supposed
to
do
.

had
two
apartments
in
the
back
that
the
lady
had
fixed
up
brand
new
and
a
big
backyard
for
the
kids
with
a
big
cedar
fence

And
he
's
doing

you
know
what
I
mean

We
made
the
best
of
it
tried
not
to
complain
You
really
have
to
yeah
.
and
made
the
best
of
it

oh
I
get
to
be
its
aunt
.

God
I
guess
it
's
happening

And
it
'll
be
okay
because
the
little
house
we
have
has
four
bedrooms
.

yeah

and
it
's
for

and
it
was
just
enough
time
you
know
.

It
's
about
eight
twenty
.

I
have
n't
talked
to
you
in
a
long
time
.

Sometimes
when
you
write
a
letter
you
figure
eventually
they
're
going
to
get
this
and
it
's
already
going
to
be
old
news

What
's
he
doing
?

Right
.

okay
.

but
I
see
that
the
he-

but
it
was
n't

They
're
big
.

That
's
the
way
it
should
be
.

okay
,

oh
.

I
hate
being
home
,

Go
on

Right
.

But
you
can
never
relax
.

He
wanted
to
invest
more
in
in
his
%um
in
in
in
his
career

I
do
n't
know
.

down
in
Florida

So
I
,
I
I

I
hope
so
too
.

so

oh
my
God

and
I
have

and
you
know
we
thought
maybe
it
's
indigestion
or
this
or
that

oh

he
's
just
absolutely
charming
guy

and
he
's
oh
God
blin-
half
blind

%huh

yeah
.

No
,

oh

%uh
this
is
a
retooling
kind
of
of
uh-huh
Blue
Shield
of
California
that
wants
to
go
from
twelve
offices
to
three

I
wrote
you
back
.

oh
great

yeah

people
are
like
you
know

well
I
mean
I
was
in
Germany
for
one
year

oh
.

I
was
thinking
of
that
too

yeah
.

yeah

%hm

and
she
said
it
would
be
like
a
you
know
she
said
you
know
we
should
really
go
to
a
conference
you
know
as
a
group
because
I
'll
be
living
with
like
four
or
five
sisters
this
fall
who
rented
a
place

oh
.

yeah
,

what
is
that
.

I
'm
a
T
V
magnet
.

yeah

yeah

So
you
guys
will
be
in
either
the
eighteenth
or
the
nineteenth

%um
,
depends
on
what
you
guys
want
to
see
.

But
%um

yeah
.

and
I
've
,
they
,
I
've
,
I
've
said
that
yeah
I
will
give
a
urine
sample
or
a
blood
sample
if
they
w-
,
if
they
call
me
back
for
those
,
but
they
're
going
to
have
to
pay
my
trip
back
to
the
states
.
because
there
's
no
bases
in
Holland
and
I
'm
not
going
to
pay
out
of
my
own
expenses
to
go
to
Germany
or
something
for
them
.

You
ca
n't
do
You
ca
n't
do
that
,

But
my
first
seventy
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
income
is
tax
free
.

Th-
,

what
,
what
is
your
income
?

So
.

If
we
have
a
phone
by
then
,
they
'll
be
able
to
give
you
the
number

I
'll
probably
never
remember
that

And
then
what
was
the
,
%um
,
reception
like
?

We
only
went
for
five
days
.

uh-huh
.

And
uh-huh
.
You
know
,
like
,
you
know
how
when
you
're
You
know
like
when
I
get
up
,
like
,
you
know
like
how
wide
you
put
your
feet
apart
when
you
get
up
?

But
you
can
see
the
line
of
your
uterus
.

It
's

and
so
you
can
feel
him
kicking
in
the
middle
of
the
night
if
you
wake
up
.

And
,
If
,
if
you
want
to
know
,
just
send
me
email
.
Because
I
looked
up
a
bunch
of
stuff
,

Well
the
only
thing
they
can
really
check
,
they
can
check
the
heart
.

They
found
out
the
baby
had
Down
's
.

If
it
's
like
that
.

And
it
's
a
hassle
,
you
know
.

Like
something
happened
to
her

That
's
like
the
size
of
a
two
year
old
is
n't
it
?

And
yet
he
's
small
.
You
know
,

what
do
you
call
it

I
can
understand
that

I
mean
I
've
had
it
for
so
long
you
know

and
so
I
do
n't
have
as
much
as
I
would
thought
I
would
have
because
I
really
want
to
buy
a
laptop

let
's
get
caught
up
on
you
first
.

I
said
I
wo
n't
be
in
New
York
.

It
's
taking
me
a
while
to
settle
in
.

and
then
%eh
it
moves

sure
.

You
're
not
into
that

oh
cool

but
it
's
the
kind
of
thing
that
I
would
like

I
mean
if
you
needed
something
about
research
or
whatever
you

but
that
that
's
okay

so

oh
really

I
have
n't
seen
the
news
in
ages
.

You
know
what
I
'm
saying
?

There
was
you
know
a
new

I
mean
it
's
,
it

or
is
it
's
creating
a
lot
of
%uh
of
%uh
resentment
?

Well
I
know
what
it
's
like
because
I
've
went
,
having
lived
over
in
Korea
for
almost
three
years
%um
it
's
you
know
when
you
come
back
all
of
a
sudden
the
you
know
the
society
has
changed
a
little
bit
you
know
.

oh
okay
.

and
they
're
restructuring
everything

but
still
I
would
like
to
know
so
I
can
tell
people
like
you
.

Well
because
you
would
n't
say
that
.

that
was
a
major
major
sta-
sta-
uh-
s-
major
point
to
reach
is
do
that
interview

It
's
a
forty
five
minute
ride
.

You
know
I
mean
I
ca
n't
say
that
to
say
I
'll
agree
and
this
is
my
commit-

One
is
that
%um
Isabelle
was
one
of
four
women
who
made
the
centering
prayer
retreat
.

yeah

or
I
do
n't
know
just
what
it
is
--
okay
--
that
they
do
.

You
said
that
.

okay
okay

So
am
I
.

She
's
--
How
--
--
amazing
.

but

and
I
g-
%uh
I
%uh
I
do
n't
know
what
point
these
letters
came
into
the
office

Well
,
you
know
she
's
worked
very
hard
all
summer

and
how
's
the
enrollment
,
Roseanne
?

oh
okay

and
%um
and
then
I
'll
keep
Jeff
just
in

A
Navy
report
on
the
suicide
bombing
released
today
does
not
recommend
any
disciplinary
action
.

270
people
died
in
the
1988
bombing
over
the
Scottish
town
of
Lockerbie
.

Before
breaking
for
dinner
delegates
held
two
sessions
lasting
eight
hours
.

Six
people
were
killed
and
dozens
of
others
injured
when
a
public
bus
was
hit
by
a
landmine
blast
about
thirty
kilometers
north
of
Srinagar
.

The
indictments
raised
to
22

number
of
those
accused
in
the
bombings

Prime
Minister
Barak
is
to
meet
with
his
top
ministers
involved
in
the
peace
process
on
Saturday
night
to
decide
what
response
to
give
to
Palestinian
leader
Yasser
Arafat
's
proposal
.

Both
sides
conditionally
accepted
his
framework
as
a
basis
for
negotiations
with
the
Palestinians
listing
a
number
of
reservations
,
but
Israel
conditioned

negotiations
on
an
end
to
Palestinian
attacks
against
Jewish
settlers
and
soldiers

Egypt

has
called
on
Israeli
leaders
to
stop
talking
about
war
and
to
make
peace
with
the
Palestinians
and
Syria
.

He
called
on
Palestinian

Yasser

to
put
an
end
to
acts
of
violence
,
saying
they
do

He

Mr.

that
it

For
those
observing
the
start
of
2001
as
a
true
dawn
of
the
twenty

the

and
fireworks
are
fewer

than

President
Clinton
has
reached
a
deal
with
independent
prosecutor
Robert
Ray

Israel

by

to
Dhaka
,
the
Bangladesh
capital

As
Dave
Gavlak
reports
,
the
US
Cole
was
towed
out
of
the
Aden
Harbor
to
a
waiting
Norwegian
transport
ship
,
that
will
actually
carry
the
damaged
destroyer
home
.

Slobodan
Milosevic
appeared
on
Serbian
television
to
announce
he
had
just
received
official
information
recognizing
the
electoral
victory
of
Vojislav
Kostunica
.

Mr.
Lubbers
will
direct
a
huge
UN
agency
with
a
more
than
one
billion
dollar
annual
budget
and
operations
in
120
countries
.

The
US
Navy
now
says
the
USS
Cole
was
being
refueled
when
an
explosion
ripped
through
it
in
Yemen
last
week
,
killing
17
.

Islamist
leaders
have
also
accused
security
forces
of
preventing
voters
from
entering
polling
stations
in
areas
where
the
opposition
is
strong
.

He
said
exactly
what
the
Indians
wanted
to
hear
,
which
is
that
the
dispute
over
Kashmir
between
India
and
Pakistan
should
be
solved
bilaterally
and
that
there
should
be
no
outside
interference
,
as
he
put
it
in
this
question
.

How
does
this
visit
by
Mr.
Putin
compare
to
President
Clinton
's
visit
earlier
this
year
?

He
has
continued
to
consult
with
both
parties
and
with
leaders
in
the
that
we
can
to
try
to
get
the
parties
to
agree
on
and
to
move
forward
on
the
agreement
we
reached
in
Egypt
.

In
what
diplomats
call
a
historic
move
,
the
United
Nations
General
Assembly
,
Tuesday
approved
a
resolution
which
was
jointly
sponsored
by
the
governments
of
North
Korea
and
South
Korea
.

The
Israeli
Army
said
that
the
Palestinian
gunmen
had
fired
at
Mrs.
Robinson
's
car
.

Israelis
and
Palestinians
have
taken
steps
to
end
three
weeks
of
violence
,
but
have
warned
of
difficulties
as
the
clashes
continue
.

Mr.
Clinton
says
he
will
withhold
final
judgment
until
he
sees
details
of
the
plan
,
which
Members
of
Congress
hammered
out
Thursday
night
,
but
he
tells
reporters
that
if
the
deal
was
what
it
appears
to
be
,
the
lawmakers
made
a
big
mistake
.

The
European
Union
is
expected
to
announce
later
today
an
easing
of
sanctions
against
Yugoslavia
,
now
the
former
leader
Slobodan
Milosevic
is
out
of
office
.

Egypt
is
carrying
out
a
three
phase
election
because
of
a
recent
decision
to
have
judges
monitor
polling
stations
in
a
bid
to
avoid
vote
rigging
.

I
'm
Dave
Deforest

All
the
evidence
does
point
very
clearly
that
the
explosion
came
outside
the
ship
.

No
US
ships
have
transited
through
the
canal
since
before
the
October
12th
attack
on
the
US
destroyer
Cole
in
Aden
,
but
Mr.
Baken
says
no
ships
were
scheduled
to
make
the
trip
for
several
weeks
.

The
Cuban
government
took
the
step
in
retaliation
for
a
Cuban
funds
bill
passed
by
the
US
Congress
.

Nearly
all
of
the
buildings
,
government
buildings
in
those
two
cities
,
have
been
reportedly
destroyed
.

The
meeting
took
place
after
an
afternoon
and
evening
of
fierce
clashes
between
the
Israeli
military
and
Palestinians
in
several
West
Bank
towns
and
Gaza
.

At
stake
are
Florida
's
25
electoral
votes
.

That
raises
questions
about
how
a
single
boat
could
have
approached
without
raising
the
suspicions
of
armed
guards
posted
as
part
of
the
heightened
alert
status
required
for
the
Cole
's
port
visit
.

Mrs.
Robinson
is
on
a
fact
-
finding
mission
,
following
complaints
by
Palestinians
that
Israeli
soldiers
have
used
excessive
force
in
a
bid
to
quell
more
than
six
weeks
of
rioting
in
the
territories

The

In

called
Mr.

a
decent
man
but
concluded
that
,
in
its
words
,
his
penchant
for
enhancement
has
become
something
of
a
running
joke
.

I
think
the
Clinton
administration
it
was
hopeful
for
Boris
Yeltsin
and
then
it
got
disappointed
in
Yeltsin
and
then
they
thought
that
reluctantly
Mr.
Putin
was
a
man
that
they
could
do
business
with
,
to
coin
former
Prime
Minister
of
Britain

Former

President
Slobodan
Milosevic
won
a
landslide
victory
Saturday
as
he
was
re-elected
leader
of
the
Socialist
Party
of
Serbia
.

At
the
same
time
Palestinians
are
saying
they
will
not
sign
a
peace
deal
with
Israel
that
fails
to
give
them
sovereignty
over
all
of
Arab
East
Jerusalem
or
allow
the
return
of
refugees
.

However
,
Palestinian
officials
say
they
were
not
involved
.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
and
Palestinian
leader
Yasser
Arafat
,
both
pledged
full
cooperation
Monday
with
the
US
led
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
the
current
spiral
of
clashes
in
the
West
Bank
and

Strip
.

We
exerted
maximum
efforts
and
we
'll
continue
to
exert
maximum
efforts
in
order
to
conclude
an
agreement
.

The
Army
's
official
news
agency
says
the
clashes
erupted
Monday
in
a
mountainous
region
northeast
of
Bogota
.

Mr.
Clark
says
US
officials
learnt
details
of
the
planned
attacks
during
the
interrogation
of
suspected
terrorists
with
links
to
exiled
Saudi
millionaire
,
Osama

Targets
included
a
police
station

last
week
with
ethnic

Albanian
rebels
attacking
Serb
positions
in
the
Presovo
valley
of
Serbia
killing
four
Serb
policemen
.

So
it
goes
both
ways
.

The
proposal
goes
considerably
beyond
the
existing
sanctions
,
which
ban
Taliban
air
flights
and
freeze
international
bank

Havana
on
Thursday
,
Mr.
Putin
and
his
wife
are
scheduled
to
head
to
one
of
Cuba
's
premier
beach
resorts
for
two
days
of
rest
before
traveling
on

His
comments
came
hours
after
Israeli
helicopters
attacked
offices
of
Mr.
Arafat
's
Fatah
movement
.

No
new
generating
stations
have
been
built
in
the
state
in
recent
years
and
some
existing
generators
are
offline
for
repairs
.

California
's
Governor
this
week
warned
that
intermittent
cutoffs
of
power
around
the
state
may
begin
as
early
as
next
week
if
nothing
more
is
done
to
alleviate
the
crisis
.

That
team
injected
a
small
amount
of
amyloid
protein
,
which
accumulates
in
brains
of
Alzheimer
's
patients
and
injected
it
in
the
mice
's
abdomens
.

Construction
delays
and
cost
-
overruns
hurt
the
project
,
which
was
originally
expected
to
cost
at
least
1
billion
300
million
dollars
.

Iraqi
Deputy
Prime
Minister
Tariq
Aziz
has
reiterated
Baghdad
's
strong
opposition
to
the
resumption
of
UN
weapons
inspections
.

This
,
however
,
is
a
toy
with
greater
ambitions
.

Few
people
can
really
know
what
it
must
be
like
to
leave
the
White
House
as
President
that
final
time
.

To
those
who
think
Bill
Clinton
has
seen
his
last
hurrah
,
he
has
this
to
say
--
``
I
may
no
longer
be
President
,
but
I
'll
be
around
.
''

This
historic
decision
will
certainly
be
remembered
as
the
one
that
put
a
President
in
the
White
House
,
but
it
may
also
become
a
decision
that
expands
the
judiciary
's
role
in
future
elections
as
well
.

Martha
Raddatz
,
ABC
News
,
the
State
Department
.

Yes
.

Just
yesterday
,
he
had
agreed
to
meet
with
the
Palestinian
leader
this
coming
week
in
Sweden
.

Now
that
investigators
have
had
their
first
major
break
,
the
confidence
level
here
has
risen
,
but
U.S.
officials
still
warn
a
long
investigation
lies
ahead
.

Today
,
one
newspaper
headline
warned
of
civil
war
.

Until
the
problems
,
Firestone
was
a
family
business
for
the
Coppenbargers
.

Georgetown

the

The
new
President
of
Yugoslavia
,
Vojislav
Kostunica
,
has
made
it
clear
he
would
not
be
likely
to
turn
over
Milosevic
or
anyone
else
to
the
war
crimes
tribunal
.

We
begin
tonight
with
a
couple
of
urgent
questions
for
the
government
.

This
raises
a
fundamental
question
--
if
the
message
had
been
more
clearly
communicated
and
understood
,
would
American
lives
have
been
saved
?

If
it
is
,
I
'll
arrest
you
.

Today
they
are
threatened
by
a
tanker
that
was
carrying
fuel
to
the
islands
.

In
yesterday
's
ruling
from
Florida
's
Supreme
Court
,
the
chief
justice
warned
recounting
undervotes
in
the
counties
would
cause
``
confusion
and
disorder
.
''

Republicans
said
,
No
way
.

From
George
Vezina
in
the
to
Gump
Worsely
,
who
had
a
face
stitched
like
a
quilt
,
and
Roy
's
hero
,
Rogie
Vachon
,
pioneer
of
an
aggressive
style
,
the
goalie
has
been
the
loner
of
the
end
of
the
rink
.

While
the
people
celebrated
,
Slobodan
Milosevic
reappeared
in
Belgrade
in
a
videotaped
meeting
.

Here
is
ABC
's
Jim
Wooten
.

They
'd
like
nothing
better
than
for
them
to
embarrass
him
in
his
own
home
state
.

This
is
someone
who
wants
to
create
a
place
for
himself
in
the
politics
of
the
future
,
even
if
it
's
simply
campaigning
at
the
side
of
his
wife
.

If
you
do
n't
have
those
filled
,
you
basically
lose
the
connection
.

the
truce
brokered
by
President
Clinton
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
allegedly
is
in
tatters
.

It
is
one
of
the
major
questions
that
was
supposed
to
be
addressed
after
the
stoning
and
shooting
had
stopped
.

However
,
the
Navy
now
says
that
hands
on
deck
who
were
manning
machine
guns
,
as
part
of
an
alert
,
still
believed
they
had
seen
this
small
boat
as
part
of
the
mooring
operation
,
and
that
is
apparently
why
they
were
not
suspicious
.

Shrapnel
killed
two
parents
and
injured
several
children
seriously
.

I
opened
up
the
door
,
and
there
was
no
deck
there
.

High
on
a
hillside
,
in
a
run
-
down
section
of
Aden
,
the
house
with
the
blue
door
has
a
perfect
view
of
the
harbor
.

Reporter

Now
this
is
the
first
nomination
to
have
been
even
mildly
controversial
,
but
it
does
go
a
long
way
to
satisfy
the
conservative
wing
of
Mr.
Bush
's
party
.

She
becomes
Sammy
``
the
bull
''
Gravano
with
better
taste
,
and
the
art
world
,
well
,
while
being
more
careful
,
perhaps
,
it
continues
to
do
business
with
the
same
two
companies
who
for
years
swindled
them
.

His
supporters
say
they
do
n't
care
that
he
has
no
chance
to
become
President
.

Thanks
for
voting
.

Thanks
,

Findlay

But
it
will
clearly
take
much
more
than
hard
work
to
make
changes
that
will
affect
not
only
Mexico
but
the
United
States
.

I
know
we
Mexicans
can
.

Reporter

This
was
an
all
-
white
,
all
-
christian
community
that
all
the
sudden
was
taken
over
--
not
taken
over
,
that
's
a
very
bad
choice
of
words
,
but
invaded
by
,
perhaps
different
groups
.

It
's
a
goal
that
seems
possible
when
on
homecoming
night
the
starting
kicker
is
14

The

the

its

evaluations
secret
from
the

Al

The

get
it
back
from
frozen
Iranian
assets
held
in
this
country

In
some

have
some
names
.

First
question
,
how
can
Florida
count
the
votes
in
64
counties
when
it
took
this
much
to
get
a
partial
count
in
three
?

Their
bodies
will
head
home
tomorrow
.

Palestinian
and
Israeli
negotiators
are
scheduled
to
meet
tomorrow
in

but
top

,
who
were
originally
expected
to
participate
in
the

,
will
not
be

The
Galapagos
are
hallowed
ground
to
many
scientists
,
for
it
was
here
that
Charles
Darwin
derived
his
theory
of
natural
selection
.

The
issue
comes
down
to
this
--
will
voters
believe
Al
Gore
's
promise
to
protect
Social
Security
the
way
it
is
?
or
will
they
take
a
gamble
and
trust
George
Bush
's
plan
to
privatize
part
of
it
?

If

to

Some
even
complained
that

hurt
team
morale
.

With
well
over
100
U.S.
investigators
now
in

,
the
search
for

is
now
fully

As
we
continue
our
coverage
of
presidential
politics
with
a
look
at
the
last
-
minute
battle
to
win
a
crucial
swing
state
,
Florida
.

Why
does
Al
Gore
say
one
thing
when
the
truth
is
another
?

All
of
this
comes
as
the
USS
Cole
is
being
carried
home
,
a
destroyer
carried
home
on
the
deck
of
a
larger
ship
after
a
hole
was
blown
in
its
side
.

Remember
,
very
often
,
the
justices
are
joint
in
another
justice
's
opinion
.

Ay
if
you
'll
check
the
national
popular
vote
,
you
'll
see
that
I
Al
Gore
have
been
proven
to
be
ipso
facto
,
the
most
popular
man
in
America
.

They
spend
a
lot
of
air
time
here
trying
to
convey
the
electoral
system
to
my
viewers
here
,
and
the
election
action
I
got
was
basically
Hey
,
this
is
undemocratic
.

I
mean
,
I
think
that
all
the
people
involved
in
this
unique
--
this
unique
situation
,
the
first
time
a
presidential
election
in
our
history
has
been
contested
,
Brian
,
need
to
do
the
right
thing
,
and
I
'm
sure
do
the
right
thing
,
as
they
see
fit
.

Most
Americans
do
n't
yet
have
a
really
good
picture
of
Laura
Bush
.

Hillary
Clinton
did
a
lot
of
things
too
.

It
was
more
of
a
show
.

We
are
also
including
the
undervotes
of
10,000
in
Palm
Beach
and
junt
votes
of
10,000
in
Miami
-
Dade
as
well
.

The
summary
of
facts
.

Accurately
,
I
think
,
and
what
more
people
are
seem
to
be
saying
to
me
is
that
they
want
an
accurate
recount
.

A
bigger
worry
to
some
advisors
is
it
's
Bush
himself
giving
Gore
room
to
attack
his
readiness
to
be
President
.

The
day
got
worse
when
he
urged
all
Americans
to
vote
on
November
2
.

Hold
that
thought
,
Dafpblet
here

Secretary
of
State
in
Florida
.

One
final
comment
.

I
know
he
Britain
and
a
friend
of
Europe
.

There
's
and
among
partisan
,
anger
.

Every
time
they
gave
you
a
set
of
count
ids
counties
that
have
been
vaulted
evaluated
,
Gore
was
getting
closer
and
closer
.

We
have
an
update
tonight
on
this
,
the
volcano
in
Mexico
,
they
call
El
Popo
.

Scientists
say
Popo
has
a
huge
crater
about
half
a
mile
across
,
about
300
feet
deep
and
a
lava
dome
is
building
up
like
an
upside
-
down
grapefruit
.

As
the
plane
was
taking
off
this
passenger
noticed
she
did
n't
see
any
runway
lights
.

Flamabable
.

It
's
a
tying
race
.

What
do
you
do
a
mile
in
?

They
do
n't
even
know
it
yet
.

Molten
rock
is
spewing
,
is
reportedly
setting
trees
afire
in
the
air
--
,
in
the
area
.

Well
,
not
just
tonight
.

Certainly
,
the
summit
did
not
conclude
this
session
without
an
overview
of
progress
on
the
customs
union
and
the
steps
for
establishing
the
Gulf
Common
Market
.

He
lived
among
people
,
observing
their
daily
lives
to
gather
information
for
the
purpose
of
enriching
his
studies
.

Your
Excellency
,
I
mean
,
this
big
crowd
perhaps
,
I
mean
,
it
is
said
that
it
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
Lebanon
,
a
crowd
of
such
,
uh
,
enormous
size
.

and
the
constitution
is
clear
.

Pope
Benedict
XVI
began
his
first
visit
to
the
lands
of
Islam
in
Ankara
.

Ah
--
the
only
alternative
is
the
dialogues
in
order
to
form
the
national
unity
government
on
the
basis
of
the
Palestinian
Document
of
National
Reconciliation
.

Long
live
democracy
,
the
democracy
that
was
able
to
coexist
well
with
dictatorship
in
France
.

So
the
Ethiopian
forces
are
from
these
,
are
among
these
forces
.

The
local
elections
can
compensate
for
it
.

So
,
dear
viewers
,
this
is
the
press
conference
of
Hajj
Hussein
Al
-
Khalil
,
political
aide
to
Hezbollah
's
Secretary
General
Sayyed
Hassan
Nasrallah
.

After
his
meeting
with
Lt.
General
Michel
Aoun
,
he
reiterated
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
Lebanese
before
anyone
else
to
search
for
the
desired
solution
.

Zebari
announced
that
Iraqi
President
Jalal
Al
Talabani
will
visit
Egypt
next
week
.

Filipino
officials
said
about
four
hundred
people
died
in
landslide
resulting
from
Hurricane
Durian
,
south
of
the
capital
,
Manila
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Factions
Coordination
Committee
intervened
to
release
those
kidnapped
from
both
sides
with
the
goal
of
preserving
the
announced
pacification
that
was
agreed
upon
by
leaders
of
the
two
factions
.

In
the
year
1990
,
the
leader
of
the
Sandinistas
,
Daniel
Ortega
,
was
asking
the
people
of
Nicaragua
to
elect
him
president
.

These
incidents
took
place
on
the
Syrian
side
of
the
border
with
Lebanon
at
the
Jdeidet
Yabus
crossing
point
,
at
a
distance
of
a
few
kilometers
from
the
Masnaa
post
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
.

Iraqi
-
Iranian
relations
have
never
in
the
past
reached
a
degree
of
complete
stability
,
and
perhaps
this
has
been
caused
by
many
geographic
,
political
and
religious
factors
.

This
choice
of
the
Ecuadorian
voters
reflects
great
hopes
on
one
hand
for
political
stability
for
the
country
,
for
which
eight
Presidents
of
the
Republic
have
alternated
since
the
year
1996
.

Palestinian
Chief
Negotiator
Saeb
Erekat
confirmed
that
Palestinians
are
fully
ready
to
negotiate
a
peaceful
settlement
with
Israel
,
and
that
is
after
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Olmert
's
announcement
of
his
readiness
to
withdraw
from
most
of
the
Palestinian
territories
in
return
for
peace
.

Regarding
strengthening
bilateral
cooperation
between
Egypt
and
Equatorial
Guinea
,
Awwad
said
that
Guinea
has
enormous
reserves
of
oil
and
gas
and
comes
in
third
in
Africa
,
and
will
attain
first
place
in
the
continent
by
the
year
2010
.

As
for
content
and
essence
,
well
-
informed
sources
harbor
hopes
that
Moussa
could
convince
the
Lebanese
factions
to
agree
on
a
common
ground
that
saves
the
country
from
entering
into
complications
with
bad
repercussions
.

We
are
then
at
the
threshold
of
street
action
,
and
this
is
what
compelled
the
vice
president
of
the
Higher
Shiite
Council
,
Abdel
-
Amir
Qabalan
to
warn
from
going
into
the
streets
because
there
is
harm
and
corruption
in
this
action
.

Durian
which
hit
the

coast
last
Thursday

caused

and

A

unknown
group
calling
itself
`

said
it
had
bombed

to
defend
Islamic
honor
and
to
avenge
the
blood
of
Palestinians
killed
by
Israelis
with
America

For
days
now
the
Russian
authorities
have
been
banging

The
weather
is
so
vital
because
if
the
weather
is
stormy
,
if
the
winds
are
strong
,
then
it
makes
it
extremely
dangerous
for
the
Russian
divers
who
will
be
going
inside
.

They
simply
did
n't
know
,
but
as
I
say
,
Admiral
Koryerov
has
said
he
does
believe
it
was
a
collision
with
a
submarine
,
and
they
're
not
sure
now
whether
it
was
a
foreign
submarine
or
a
Russian
one
?

In
fact
he
had
to
burn
up
an
entire
suitcase
full
of
hundreds
of
poems
and
plays
and
stories
at
the
start
of
the
Cultural
Revolution
in
fear
of
going
to
prison
,
and
then
in
1983
after
being
diagnosed
with
lung
cancer
,
which
had
killed
his
father
three
years
earlier
and
being
convinced
that
he
himself
was
going
to
die
,
he
gets
a
kind
of
reprieve
.

The
World
's
Richard
Myron
is
in
Tel
Aviv
now
.

Are
they
even
paying
heed
to
what
is
happening
in
Washington
?

Thank
you
Richard
for
the
update
.

Yes
,
it
has
all
happened
actually
very
,
very
quickly
.

Today
,
the
country
was
admitted
into
an
international
Balkan
development
program
.

Writer
Vojislav
Jonetic
says
he
is
confident
the
new
Yugoslav
government
will
provide
plenty
of
fresh
material
.

In
a
way
presidents
do
n't
normally
pay
as
much
attention
to
Northern
Ireland
as
Clinton
has
,
so
he
has
actually
paid
the
Irish
question
probably
too
much
attention
for
a
President
,
and
what
that
means
is
that
the
people
involved
in
the
peace
process
here
believe
they
are
more
important
than
they
actually
are
.

This
is
NPR
News
.

President
Vicente
Fox
touched
on
the
biggest
,
most
troubling
issues
facing
Mexicans
today
.

Is
that
issue
something
that
Fox
is
likely
to
pay
attention
to
?

Clearly
,
this
is
a
man
who
was
travelling
on
some
other
passport
somewhere
in
Europe
,
whether
or
not
an
Israeli
citizen
,
we
do
n't
know
it
for
sure
.

Now
there
have
subsequently
been
accusations
that
the
Lebanese
Hezbollah
has
tried
to
influence
the
Palestinians
toward
armed
revolt
.

It
's
a
sensible
thing
to
ask
-
Does
one
virus
cause
a
syndrome
?

But
President
Embeke
is
n't
backing
down
.

I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
terrorism
or
not
.

On
Yemeni
TV
today
the
country
's
President
expressed
his
heart
-
felt
condolences
to
those
who
were
killed
and
injured
,
but
denied
that
the
explosion
on
board
the
cole
was
caused
by
terrorists
,
although
,
admits
Mohammed
Al
-
Qadhi
,
editor
of
the
Yemen
Observer
newspaper
in
the
capital
Sana
,
<ENAMEX
TYPE="NORP"
S_OFF="5">anti-American
sentiment
has
been
running
high
in
Yemen
because
of
events
in
the
Middle
East
.

More
than
200
people
have
died
,
most
of
them
children
.

And
I
say
it
is
because
we
are
a
democracy
that
it
's
happening
this
way
.

I
am
very
confident
that
our
form
of
government
that
checks
and
balances
the
way
we
set
the
process
up
and
the
way
it
is
moving
,
so
many
things
to
fall
back
on
to
keep
the
process
moving
,
that
I
am
not
really
concerned
at
all
.

Cuniket
says
,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
public
pressure
on
Chavez
to
live
up
to
his
many
campaign
promises
,
such
as
distributing
land
and
wealth
more
equally
among
Venezuelans
.

His
departure
will
open
the
way
for
the
new
President
,
Vojislav
Kostunica
to
rein
in
the
police
force
,
which
has
traditionally
been
a
staunch
defender
of
Mr.
Milosevic
.

The
popular
uprising
which
swept
Vojislav
Kostunica
to
power
,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
took
to
the
streets
in
early
October
to
force
Slobodan
Milosevic
to
accept
his
election
defeat
and
step
down
.

The
Yemeni
coastline
is
a
sear
for
terrorists
,
but
it
was
the
best
option
available
for
refueling
ships
.

We
do
n't
want
to
be
speculating
.

Yes
,
he
did
.

PBS
produce
their
albums
in
New
York
.

So
before
they
say
it
is
a
white
man
tangle
you
know
it
's
because
of
a
white
man
that
this
happens
and
they
got
to
,
you
know
,
check
around
and
they
say
who
is
the
real
guilty
.

It
was
apparently
engineered
by
President
Vladimir
Putin
during
his
talks
with
Mr.
Arafat
.

But
your
post-election
dilemma
leads
me
to
put
forward
a
number
of
ideas
to
assist
you
at
this
,
the
most
critical
moment
Americans
have
faced
since
they
changed
the
taste
of
Coke
.

The
UN
is
warning
millions
of
people
face
starvation
in
North
Korea
unless
foreign
aid
is
dramatically
increased
.

We
will
find
you
and
justice
will
prevail
.

No
,
no
that
's
not
good
.

For
The
World
,
this
is
Tinku
Ray
,
New
Delhi
.

In
the
city
's
commercial
district
,
an
employee
at
the
Rositas
Fabric
and
Clothing
Store
shouts
out
today
's
bargain
prices
of
the
Pa
.

These
men
have
seen
all
types
of
victims
,
students
,
housewives
,
taxi
drivers
and
businessmen
among
others
,
but
this
one
hits
the
police
hard
because
of
her
age
.

Egypt
called
the
emergency
summit
to
declare
support
for
the
Palestinians
in
the
wake
of
three
weeks
of
violence
that
has
left
at
least
106
people
dead
,
almost
all
of
them
Palestinian
.

It
will
not
want
to
see
anything
too
strong
coming
out
of
this
summit
due
to
end
on
Sunday
.

Barak
's
statement
is
seen
as
an
attempt
to
seize
the
initiative
after
it
appeared
likely
he
would
lose
the
debate
.

In
addition
to
not
being
allowed
to
enter
Israel
,
Palestinians
are
not
permitted
to
travel
between
the
West
Bank
cities
now
.

Naval
Captain
Biltera
Pedro
says
it
's
against
tradition
that
sailors
have
respected
for
centuries
and
could
also
cause
great
grief
.

Firstly
,
that
a
torpedo
missile
misfired
while
still
in
the
tube
causing
a
massive
explosion
in
the
armory
,
secondly
,
that
the
sub
hit
a
mine
leftover
from
World
War
II
,
and
thirdly
,
a
collision
with
another
vessel
.

Barak
announced
2
weeks
ago
that
he
would
call
for
early
elections
.

Gushin
Baskin
,
co-director
of
the
Israel
-
Palestine
Center
for
Research
and
Information
says
that
the
prospects
of
an
election
in
Israel
could
improve
the
chances
for
peace
.

At
least
65
people
are
known
to
have
been
killed
and
around
30
passengers
remain
unaccounted
for
.

This
is
the
World
.

Then
the
crowd
marched
over
to
the
state
run
televison
station
.

By
all
appearances
,
Japan
would
seem
a
natural
candidate
to
be
the
next
internet
superpower
.

As
you
start
moving
down
this
path
towards
technical
innovation
,
it
invites
disruption
or
it
brings
about
the
conflict
much
quicker
than
I
think
most
people
would
be
prepared
to
start
dealing
with
it
.

He
is
a
real
gentleman
.

He
is
highly
critical
of
them
and
their
attitude
,
but
he
always
put
forward
reasons
for
his
attitude
.

People
are
demonstrating
for
the
price
increase
fuel
and
everything
.

This
year
's
crop
is
down
because
of
the
continuing
occupation
of
white
owned
farms
.

Israeli
and
Palestinian
negotiators
will
hold
separate
meetings
with
US
officials
.

The
move
comes
as
the
judge
decides
whether
to
order
a
recount
of
those
ballots
in
the
presidential
election
.

There
are
a
lot
of
things
about
the
election
's
process
I
think
that
are
fairly
complex
.

British
police
are
puzzling
over
an
item
of
stolen
property
which
has
just
been
recovered
.

Despite
its
clunking
sound
it
was
one
of
Hitler
's
secret
weapons
.

For
The
World
,
this
is
Stephen
Beard
in
London
.

The
committee
heard
from
angry
voters
and
precinct
workers
in
Palm
Beach
.

The
Federal
Parliament
here
is
on
fire
.

You
are
just
contributing
with
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
you
are
monitoring
the
growing
up
.

Thank
you
very
much
Carlo
.

President
Clinton
was
back
in
Ireland
today
during
the
first
leg
of
a
3
-
day
trip
that
will
also
take
him
to
Belfast
and
London
.

Everybody
asked
me
about
President
Milosevic
.

You
can
be
sure
he
is
still
pulling
all
his
political
strings
.

Last
night
Cubans
retreated
to
never
-
before
seen
footage
of
Elian
Gonzalez
's
first
encounter
with
President
Fidel
Castro
.

I
would
say
so
that
Sartre
has
been
a
quite
a
big
influence
.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
said
he
would
retaliate
.

Well
apparently
,
photo
lens
in
your
pocket
or
are
you
just
pleased
to
see
me
.

But
it
is
pretty
amazing
,
all
these
Hollywood
stars
in
this
quiet
,
sleepy
village
that
is
n't
really
famous
for
anything
.

Nenad
,
what
do
we
know
of
this
Milosevic
ally
?

That
part
of
the
resolution
here
and
the
resolution
was
never
actually
applied
because
right
until
now
,
the
Yugoslav
police
and
military
were
in
the
hands
of
Milosevic
,
so
the
international
community
did
n't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Milosevic
forces
.

Katy
Clark
,
BBC
News
,
Islamabad
.

Clashes
between
Israeli
Army
units
and
Palestinians
have
continued
into
the
night
.

This
has
to
cease
.

Well
,
there
have
been
cases
in
most
recent
elections
in
France
where
the
Coseque
Constitutionalle
having
been
apprised
of
doubtful
procedures
or
doubtful
ways
of
counting
the
votes
,
have
decided
either
to
the
election
and
have
it
done
over
again
or
to
in
fact
change
the
winner
.

When
Milosevic
was
indited
on
war
crimes
charges
soon
after
,
US
and
other
Western
officials
began
calling
for
his
arrest
and
transfer
to
The
Hague
,
but
now
that
a
delicate
transition
is
underway
in
Serbia
,
those
calls
have
grown
quieter
,
according
to
Gary
Bass
,
the
author
of
the
new
book
about
war
crimes
trials
,
`
Stay
,
the
Hand
of
Vengeance
'
.

This
does
not
seem
terribly
compelling
to
me
.

In
Solace
he
serves
as
the
utility
player
,
handling
not
only
flute
but
also
the
Irish
hand
drum
,
the
boran
and
the
Indian
pipes
.

That
is
split
between
various
tribal
groups
and
there
is
also
,
as
I
mentioned
,
extremists
that
look
at
Yemen
as
,
say
,
heaven
.

Clinton
is
also
considering
clemency
for
several
other
convicted
criminals
.

Even
husbands
or
wives
will
start
making
calculations
about
the
future
.

Despite
all
the
criticism
and
the
media
spotlight
Lu
Yo
Ching
's
wife
Shu
Mu
Yeng
says
she
believes
that
his
decision
to
write
the
diary
was
a
good
thing
.

I
would
think
there
are
risks
of
bringing
it
up
as
well
.

They
have
already
presented
their
rescue
plans
to
the
European
Union
.

Gaza
was
sealed
off
after
the
killing
of
the
Jewish
settler
,
reversing
the
limited
successes
of
last
week
's
peace
talks
.

More
than
300
people
have
been
killed
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
since
September
.

Mr.
Barak
is
trying
to
sell
an
historic
peace
agreement
to
a
public
that
would
n't
even
buy
a
used
car
from
him
.

Since
the
bombing
he
has
had
psychological
problems
and
has
found
himself
locked
in
a
police
cell
on
three
occasions
after
being
picked
up
.

But
the
man
the
United
States
believes
masterminded
the
attacks
,
Osama
Bin
Laden
is
still
at
large
.

They
closed
their
case
after
failing
to
obtain
what
they
say
is
crucial
evidence
from
Syria
.

Out
in
the
harbor
preparations
are
being
made
to
attach
cables
to
the
tanker
so
that
it
can
be
floated
and
towed
out
to
sea
,
where
it
's
expected
to
be
sunk
.

Before
rushing
back
for
fresh
talks
with
Palestinian
negotiators
this
evening
,
Ben
-
Ami
acknowledged
that
an
agreement
probably
would
n't
happen
before
the
end
of
President
Clinton
's
term
later
this
month
and
Sharon
supporters
are
castigating
Barak
for
bringing
chaos
in
place
of
the
peace
deal
he
promised
.

Some
left
-
wingers
in
Israel
are
now
quietly
suggesting
that
it
may
be
better
for
Barak
to
step
down
before
the
election
and
allow
the
veteran
Shimon
Peres
to
stand
in
his
place
against
Sharon
,
but
in
the
absence
of
the
peace
agreement
,
it
may
be
difficult
for
any
left
winger
to
win
over
an
increasingly
skeptical
Israeli
public
.

Cameras
captured
a
tornado
on
the
ground
in
Missouri
.

Who
is
the
latest
target
?

With
the
success
of
a
new
television
show
and
last
year
's
Oz-fest
tour
ready
to
kick
off
,
things
were
looking
great
for
Ozzy
Osbourne
.

Some
days
when
I
'm
feeling
bad
,
I
say
I
ca
n't
do
this
anymore
,
and
then
you
wake
up
and
see
the
crew
,
and
then
,
you
know
,
you
snap
out
of
it
.

I
would
n't
be
here
now
if
it
was
n't
for
my
wife
.

Despite
problems
--

You
are
looking
at
some
of
the
images
.

We
're
also
checking
out
other
developments
right
now
,
including
this
story
that
's
just
coming
in
from
the
Associated
Press
right
now
.

Murdoch
today
promised
that
if
the
rules
are
changed
he
will
limit
future
purchases
to
a
few
of
what
he
calls
sizable
markets
.

They
serve
on
each
other
's
boards
and
problem
here
is
gap
between
what
the
average
worker
makes
and
CEO
is
making
is
increasing
and
everyone
agrees
that
is
not
a
good
thing
for
this
country
,
plus
the
fact
,
when
the
guys
get
the
big
packages
,
so
often
you
see
the
companies
going
down
the
zblubs
.

No
sooner
did
the
unions
agree
to
these
concessions
than
it
became
known
that
Carty
and
some
of
his
top
executives
had
been
given
a
bit
of
a
package
of
perks
,
perks
that
included
a
trust
fund
to
protect
some
of
the
pensions
in
the
event
of
a
bankruptcy
as
well
as
retention
bonuses
.

Shyly
a
modest
cake
for
his
50th
birthday
.

The
revelations
are
part
of
a
just
published
biography
about
the
35th
President
.

The
Vice
President
Dick
Cheney
is
now
speaking
in
Washington
at
a
luncheon
honoring
the
Secretary
of
Defense
,
Donald
Rumsfeld
.

For
the
second
day
in
a
row
,
Lieutenant
General
Jay
Garner
was
mobbed
by
friendly
crowds
after
touring
a
Kurdish
school
in
the
northern
Iraqi
city
of
Irbil
.

He
joins
us
live
with
the
details
.

There
is
the
picture
.

The
puppies
try
to
nurse
the
chicken
hen
.

Then
I
'll
try
to
give
you
my
best
guesstimation
.

There
's
a
reason
she
was
successful
,
and
the
stuff
that
she
's
created
people
like
.

Reporter
:

When
we
sat
down
to
lunch
,
she
had
put
out
these
beautiful
chop
sticks
which
I
commented
on
.

I
just
think
about
all
the
family
members
sitting
at
home
,
sitting
on
the
dock
looking
at
this
boat
coming
in
.

Just
about
to
come
home
.

She
was
one
of
the
water
skiers
.

Leon
,
hello
to
you
.

So
I
do
n't
want
anyone
to
misconstrue
what
I
said
.

Reporter
:

Interesting
story
because
we
thought
things
were
wrapped
up
a
couple
district
attorneys
ago
.

Police
say
Jennifer
O'Conner
,
a
Connecticut
woman
with
a
history
of
psychiatric
problems
confessed
to
shooting
her
daughter
7
,
while
the
7
-
year
-
old
girl
lay
sleeping
.

19
of
them
are
still
there
.

They
also
wear
float
coats
.

Depending
on
the
water
temperature

The

slept

This

then
this

we
're
hearing
it
appear
as
though
perhaps
there
has
been
another

Do
you

Yeah

Several

have
filed
for

their
reporters
had
with
Scott
Peterson
.

Up

,
on
``
CNN
Live

''
,
sentencing
this
hour
in
the
case
of
Sam
Waksal
,
the
man
at
the
center
of
the
Martha
Stewart
scandal
.

Michael
Sears
was
determined
to
prove
he
was
no
longer
a
threat
.

Martha
Stewart
is
n't
the
only
corporate
figurehead
in
the
news
today
.

Here
's
national
security
correspondent
David
Ensor
.

When
we
come
back
,
President
Bush
has
not
claimed
victory
in
Iraq
last
night
,
but
what
about
the
tournament
war
on
terror
?

We
are
back
on
stage
looking
online
good
.

The
endorsement
came
as
Greenspan
was
scheduled
for
surgery
to
treat
an
enlarged
prostate
.

It
was
n't
part
of
a
security
check
.

Now
three
days
later
his
water
ran
out
and
on
the
fifth
day
he
made
the
unimaginable
decision
to
amputate
his
arm
below
the
elbow
with
a
pocket
knife
.

Our
new
hotel
matrix
is
loaded
with
options
.

The
President
called
that
meeting
helpful
and
said
the
disagreement
between
the
United
States
and
France
over
Iraq
does
not
mean
the
two
countries
have
to
be
disagreeable
.

Secretary
Page
and
his
department
will
continue
working
with
the
rest
of
the
states
to
get
the
plans
approved
as
quickly
as
possible
.

No
matter
what
your
circumstances
in
life
,
you
can
always
give
.

There
are
a
number
--
there
are
15,000
companies
in
the
United
States
,
and
I
think
the
great
bulk
of
them
are
very
honestly
managed
and
so
forth
.

And
with
you
as
Chairman
of
the
SEC
exercising
your
bully
pulpit
,
one
assumes
that
--

What
I
'm
going
to
do
?

Reporter

Both

Second

Putin

that
you
're
seeing
now
here
in

London
.

At
the
very
beginning
,
it
was
encouraged
by
Israel
because
they
thought
it
was
a
counter
weight
to
Palestinian
nationalism
which
is
,
of
course
,
a
secular
movement
.

We
are
all
saying
that
the
resistance
will
continue
despite
the
summit
in
Aqaba
.

and
now
Aaron

according
to

gusty
winds
up

40

50
miles
an
hour
,
and
it
came
from
southeast
,
and
we
got
the
alarm
this
distress
situation
just
before
5:00
in
the
morning
,
and
we
were
on
relatively
slow
speed
for
the
time
being
,
but
we
of
course
,
speeded
up
to
the
position
,
which
was
given
,
and
we
--
after
an
hour
,
we
spotted
the
fishing
boat
in
the
waters
.

Amazing
.

These
kids
are
at
that
magical
age
when

last
a

They
're
still
young

they

Do
they

the

the

confirming
that
,
in

,
returning
all

Strip

is
one

the
options

over
what

In

according

station
Legend

Qarase

In
October
of
this
year
,
in
response
to
the
prospect
of
continuous
decline
in
international
oil
prices
,
OPEC
held
a
special
ministerial
conference
and
decided
to
reduce
daily
oil
output
by
1.2
million
barrels
starting
from
November
1
.

A
regiment
of
the
Second
Artillery
Corps
,
which
has
just
passed
the
general
staff
's
operational
capability
assessment
,
conducted
a
new
round

Therefore

the

reminds

not

above
seven
schools
when
applying
for

However
,
whatever
the
final
result

,
analysts
pointed
out
that
voters

either
high

low

rate
on

and
the
proportion
trend
of
undecided

will
all
be
the
important

even

He
's

as
NBC

Jim

reports
tonight
from

,
many
of
the
families
of
the

think
the
verdict
did

But
even

U.S.

Good

Her

,
was
a
success
,
and
her
case
an
example
of
the
startling
differences
in
doctors
'
choices
of
treatment
,
from
one
geographic
area
to
the
next
.

This
year
,
the
federal
government
is
spending
nearly
$
123
billion
on
education
.

What
's
more
,
his
plan
merely
would
modestly
expand
an
existing
tuition
credit
.

Most
misleading
of
all
,
experts
say
,
is
each
candidate
's
claim
that
his
plan
can
dramatically
improve
public
education
.

And
the
ripple
effect
from
<ENAMEX

tire
troubles
being
felt
across
the
country
tonight
.

That
was
the
subject
of
a

hearing
today
.

As
a
result
,
airlines
will
have
to
get
rid
of
131
flights
a

at
La

by

.

Other
vets
however
,
like
former
senator
Bob
Dole
,
say
it
's
not
only
the
right
place
,
it
's
about
time
.

As
Gore
considers
his
options
with
his
family
,
advisers
say
he
and
the
campaign
realize
they
are
operating
on
two
distinct
and
delicate
tracts
--
legal
,
which
they
will
pursue
to
keep
options
open
,
and
political
,
which
they
have
to
watch
carefully
as
they
feel
mounting
pressure
.

Whatever
the
Supreme
Court
decides
this
time
,
you
say
this
case
could
come
back
before
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
again
?

The
Justice
Department
says
no
group
or
individual
has
been
ruled
out
as
a
suspect
,
though
many
expect
that
whoever
gets
the
blame
will
eventually
be
tied
to
the
terrorist
Osama
bin
Laden
.

Bill
Clinton
and
Al
Gore
have
had
every
chance
and
every
reason
to
improve
our
schools
,
to
raise
taxes
,
to
save
Social
Security
,
but
they
have
n't
even
tried
.

Now
NBC
's
chief
financial
correspondent
Mike
Jensen
on
the
new
surplus
and
all
the
talk
behind
it
,
``
in
depth
.
''

If
the
economy
takes
a
major
hit
,
more
than
just
a
mild
recession
,
experts
say
you
can
subtract
$
1
trillion
from
the
surplus
.

One
that
I
've
worked
on
a
lot
,
one
people
do
n't
talk
about
,
is
global

.

Petroleum
companies
were
also
popular
because
of
expectations
of
a
weaker
dollar
,
which
cuts

.

The
agency
said
it
monitored
Newmark

before

after
the
ad
campaign
,
and
found
that
the
prices
of
at

50
different
items
either
increased
or
stayed
the

For
the
past
five

worry
that

makes

Any
major
attempt
to
revamp
the
health

care
system
is
likely
to
trigger
opposition
from
politically
powerful
interest
groups
,
particularly
the
American
Medical
Association
,
and
perhaps
from
the
public
as
well
,
if
Congress
takes
steps
that
patients
fear
will
limit
the
availability
of

Mr.

You
'd
think
all
the

about

-

communities
and
developers
getting
HUD
grants
would
prompt
Congress
to
tighten
up
on
upscale

.

And
the
majority
of

cynically
view
the
current
discrediting
of

as
mainly
a
chance
to
shove
through

he

this
does

mean
he
is
satisfied

For

,
Mr.

said
that

that
they
can
cause

in

regardless

Permission

they
appear
to
be
exercising
these
powers

By
contrast
,
a
parliamentary
system
based

abstract

held
to
cause

rather

conflict

If
he

he

in

suit
Warner
brought
against

for

two
producers
,
Mr.

Warner
denies
such

disputes
the
Guber

Peters
version
of
virtually
every
telephone
call
and
meeting
the
two
sides
had
on
the
matter
.

He
says
he
told
Mr.
Guber
he
could
n't
sign
any
documents
and
that
``
the
deal
,
although
apparently
a
good
one
for
him
and
Mr.
Peters
,
would
have
a
very
negative
impact

The
rationale
for
responding
to
your

needs
faster
than
the
competition
can
is
clear
:
Your

will
benefit
in
terms
of
market

,
customer
satisfaction
and
profitability

The

eliminated
the

The

is
subject

But
to
Ms.

,
the

triggered
a

,
the

was
simple

Vitaly
Korotich
,
editor

blazing
weekly
Ogonyok
,
Friday
,
Oct.
20
was
a
somersaulting
day
that
turned
from
tension
to
elation
.

The
same
evening
that
he
was
summoned
for
a
warning
from
the
Party
,
he
was
cheered
by
thousands
of
his
supporters
at
a
rally
of
what
can
only
be
called
the
Korotich
party
.

Stuart
E.
Eizenstat
,
a

in
the

Frazer
-AMP-
Murphy
,
was
named
a
director
of
this
utility
holding
company
,
increasing
board
membership
to
14
.

The
increase
reflects
spending
on
the
S-AMP-L
rescue
as
well
as
payroll
and
Social
Security
checks
normally
issued
in
October
that
were
issued
in
September
this
year
because
Oct.

fell
on

.

This
pattern
was
particularly
evident
among

highly

But
,
says
chief
investigator
Tom
Smith
,
this
``
does
not
translate

into

positions
on

issues

``
It
's
contrary

''
she
added
.

If
nothing
else
,
such

as
these
will
provide
an
awareness
to
citizens

and
encourage
appropriate
corrective
action

Curdling
Confession

While
Boeing
's
commercial
business
is
booming
,
its
military
business
is
feeling
the
effects
of
a
declining
defense
budget
after
a
strong
buildup
during
the
Reagan
presidency
.

Though
it
is
far
from
certain
that
companies
best
known
for
selling
Promise
margarine
and
Tide
detergent
will
succeed
in
cosmetics
,
there
's
little
doubt
they
will
shake
up
the
industry
.

The
company
says
sales
have
soared
.

Sales
of
its
Tide
detergent
soared
earlier
this
year
,
for
example
,
after
P-AMP-G
introduced
a
version
that
includes
a
bleach
safe
for
all
colors
and
fabrics
.

Otherwise
,
actual
profit
is
compared
with
the
300

estimate
.

What
's
more
,
the
seven

aboard

missing

The
confusion
could
be
costly
.

Sir
Geoffrey

,
deputy
prime
minister
and
a
Lawson
ally
on
the
EMS
,
has
signaled
he
will
continue
pressing

early
membership
.

The
officials
said
the
meeting
agreed
to
continue
working
toward
``

Cocom

and
to
improve

the

retains
its
signature

is
less
intimidating

But
it
's
more
like
an
illustration
of
what
Ben
Stein
describes
in
his
study
of
social
attitudes
in
the
TV
industry
:
``
Fear
of
violence
and
animosity
...
because
of
race
or
religion
,
fear
and
lack
of
comprehension
about
the
politics

small

town
people
...
produce
a
powerful
wave
of
dislike
of
small
towns
in
the
minds
of
TV
writers
and
producers
.

As
for
the
women
,
they
're
pathetic
.

As
there
is
an
effort
to
``
anchor
the
dollar
''
either
to

or
other

,
the
dispute
is
worth
examining
.

It
is
extraordinary

thought
it
could
prevent

deficit
by
inflating

worried

Co.
has
launched
a
controversial
``
frequent
drinker
''
promotion
for
its
Chivas
Regal
brand
.

But
Goya
Foods
Inc.
believes
it
can
milk
some
sales
by
bucking
the
trend
.

They
're
hiring
models
to
stroll
the
aisles
sporting
their
jewels
,
and
they
're
even
beginning
to
borrow
a
perennial
favorite
of
the
beauty
business
--
offering
a
gift
when
consumers
make
a
purchase
.

On
the
mound
,
former
Red
Sox
great
Luis
Tiant
,
the
wily
master
of
1,001
moves
,
throws
an
off
-
speed
strike
.

The
league
is
the
brainchild
of
Colorado
real
estate
developer
James
Morley
--
once
a
minor
-
leaguer
himself
--
who
says
he
had
the
idea
last
January
while
lying
on
a
beach
in
Australia
.

He
means
the
rule
that
a
player
ca
n't
cut
it
after
a
certain
age
.

He
's
not
thinking
about
home
runs
anymore
,
just
base
hits
.

Four
of
the
planes
were
purchased
by
International
Lease
from
Singapore
Airlines
in
a
previously
announced
transaction
.

They
sow
a
row
of
male
-
fertile
plants
nearby
,
which
then
pollinate
the
male
-
sterile
plants
.

In
recent
years
,
demand
for
hybrid
seeds
has
spurred
research
at
a
number
of
chemical
and
biotechnology
companies
,
including
Monsanto
Co.
,
Shell
Oil
Co.
and
Eli
Lilly
-AMP-
Co
.

The
lumber
,
insulation
and
fireproofing
concern
said
the
transaction
,
which
includes
a
swap
of
other
timber
interests
,
would
result
in
a
$
13.5
million
after
-
tax
gain
,
to
be
recorded
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

New
Brunswick
Scientific
Co.
,
a
maker
of
biotechnology
instrumentation
and
equipment
,
said
it
adopted
an
anti-takeover
plan
giving
shareholders
the
right
to
purchase
shares
at
half
price
under
certain
conditions
.

Mr.
Azoff
has
n't
named
the
company
yet
,
but
any
records
it
produces
will
be
distributed
by
Warner
.

Hardly
a
day
passes
without
news
photos
of
the
police
dragging
limp
protesters
from
some
building
or
thoroughfare
in
one
of
our
cities
.

Demonstrations
are
particularly
apt
to
degenerate
into
criminal
conduct
when
they
leave
the
site
of
the
grievance
and
become
mobile
.

It
might
be
alleged
that
TV
has
done
more
than
its
share
to
popularize
and
promote
non-violent
civil
disobedience
,
so
the
second
situation
hypothesized
above
would
be
simply
a
case
of
``
chickens
coming
home
to
roost
.

The
big
one
:
A
company
's
culture
ca
n't
be
radically
changed
unless
top
management
first
admits
that
things
have
gone
badly
awry
and
then
publicly
leads
the
charge
.

Other
trips
were
more
productive
.

Nissan
had
29
%
of
the
Japanese
car
market
in
1980
before
beginning
a
depressing
eight
-
year
slide
that
continued
through
last
year
.

Nissan
started
advertising
Infiniti
fully
eight
months
before
the
cars
hit
American
showrooms
.

And
in
July
,
Nissan
's
Tennessee
manufacturing
plant
beat
back
a
United
Auto
Workers
organizing
effort
with
aggressive
tactics
that
have
left
some
workers
bitter
.

That
does
n't
appear
to
be
the
case
in
Singapore
,
a
country
of
about
three
million
people
with
a
relatively
high
soft

drink
consumption
rate
--
a
key
indicator
of
Coke

success
in

The

Hunt

owe

after
his

He
said
summer
drought
problems
that

hit
several
southern

in
September

The
personal
antics
of
agency
Director
Amadou

Mahtar
M'Bow
drew
much
attention
,
such
as
when
several
of
his
top
aides
were
uncovered
as
KGB
plants
and
ejected
from
France
and
when
a
mysterious
office
fire
was
set
just
before
Congress
sent
accountants
to
trace
U.S.

.

The

held
after

assassination
of
his

to
unite
,
and
its
success
will
be
clear
only
when

Many
Indians
fear
a
repeat
of
that
experience
.

July
18
,
1989
:

Early
yesterday
,
investors
scrambled
to
buy
Treasury
bonds
for
safety
as
stock
prices
plummeted
and
fears
mounted
of
a
replay
of
Friday
.

``
They
shot
the
whole
orchestra
just
because
the
piano
player
hit
a
bad
note

''
said
Laszlo
Birinyi
,
president
of
Birinyi

,
referring
to
the
stock

's
plunge
Friday
on
news

out
.

Also
,
Jean
B.
Clifton
,
28
,
was
named
executive
vice
president
,
treasurer
and
chief
financial
officer
.

It
is
probably
continuing
and
may
well
account
for
most
of
,
or
all
of
,
present

day
global
warming
.

He
said
that
while
the
U.S.

widened
significantly
,
the

Fortunately
,
the
nations

Africa
have

totally
surrendered
their
sovereignty
.

The

In

At
the

,
however
,
Pakistani
officials
sent
in
Gulbuddin

,
perhaps
the
most
hated
and
feared
of
the

,
with
a
demand
that
the
surrender
be
made
to
his
forces

When
Maj.

was
buried
,
his

bore
several
gunshot
wounds
,
a
cracked

and
broken
legs
and

.

Yet
he
has
proved
more
resilient
than
any
of
them
.

Tony

four

older
than

``
It

recalls
Mr.

One
DEA
agent
drew
up
a
list
of
five
options
for
dealing
with
Col.
Noriega
,
one
of
which
was
assassination
.

It
was
a
Friday
in
June
.

Payments
averaged
nearly
$
200,000
a
year
from
the
U.S.
Defense
Intelligence
Agency
and
the
CIA
.

Mr.
Noriega
was
accused
of
ordering
in
1985
the
beheading
of
Hugo
Spadafora
,
his
most
outspoken
political
opponent
and
the
first
man
to
publicly
finger
Mr.
Noriega
on
drug
trafficking
charges
.

Mr.
Noriega
believes
he
has
n't
any
alternative
but
to
continue
clutching
to
power
.

The
money
will
be
applied
for
voter
registration
and
election
monitoring
,
but
more
than
half
is
likely
to
go
to
the
Union
Nacional
Opositora
party
.

The
same
issue
threatens
to
spill
over
to
the
foreign
aid
debate
,
and
Mr.

also
is
threatening

The
Section
89
victory
could
have
a
downside
by
making
it
harder
to
oppose

Stan
Hathcock
,
an
Atlanta

owner
who
opposes
a

him
as
much
as

Returns

Brown

;
but
testimony
of
his
mother

about
his
father

of
an
ex-employer
about
his
honesty
and

satisfied
a
judge
that
Brown
was
truthful

his
tale
of

was
possible

He
declined
to
elaborate

were

Asked
about
the
consultants
'
reports
,
an
Eastern
spokeswoman
said
``
we
totally
disagree

''

The
experts
said
they
expected
Eastern
would
have
to
issue
new
debt
to
cover
its
costs
,
and
that
it
would
generate
far
less
cash
than
anticipated

Hudson

There
is
little
incentive
to
buy
gold
because
if
the
stock
market
goes
higher
,
it
may
be
just
a
false

It
was
the
possibility
of
this
demand
that
helped
firm
prices
,
the
analyst
said
.

The
IRS

Frank

This

a

have
failed

causing
jitters
among

,
and
Mr.

apparently
wanted
assurances
that
he
wo

He
said
that

``

As
we
will
see
,
many
of
these
obligations
do
n't
show
up
as
part
of
the
federal
deficit
.

Credit
policy
should
separate
these
two
competing

eliminate
aspects
that
provide
the
subsidy
.

Since

measures

is
treated
as
a

loan
will
be
paid

But
the

now
claims
that
a

engaged

elaborate

obscure

said
.

But
a
Commerce

analyst
said
that
in
both

orders
would
have
risen
had
it
not
been
for
a
drop
in
civilian
aircraft
bookings
,
a
category
that
is
showing
declines
only
after
a
huge
surge
earlier
this

.

For

,
disaster

,

go

,
offer

as

Sometime

.

In
addition
,
changes
in
short

in
some

may
be
caused
by
arbitrage
.

The
company
earns
about
half
its

overseas

By
not

If

not

they

Because

The
Panamanian

only
the
tip

It
was
therefore
not

that
close

With

One
simple
approach
is
to
exclude

this

at

Mr.

said
flatly

Mr.

's
problem
is
n't
so
much
that
he
seems
to
be
agonizing
over
the
issue
as
it
is
that
he
seems
to
vacillate
on
it
.

In
April
1986
,
then
-
Vice
President
Bush
had
his
staff
write
a
letter
spelling
out
that
he
would
support
a
constitutional
amendment
banning
abortions
except
in
cases
of
rape
,
incest
and
life
endangerment
,
but
that
he
opposed
federal
funding
in
all

the
latter
case

After

they

,
the

exercise

from
another
investor
who
has
sold
a
put
on
the

Ultimately
,
whether
the
insurance
provided
by
purchasing
puts
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
options
.

Such
spillover
effects
give
the
state
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
marketplace
and
temporarily
coordinate

Further
ammunition
came
from
left
legal

Ronald

,
who
in

a

One
can
understand
Mr.

stretched

composed
of
men

realism

guts

should
be
able

The

We

they
all
seem
to
be
saying
the

thing

But
while
making
the
obvious
point
that

variations

this

ignores
the

--
``

I

.

But
the

also
includes
the
unpleasant
truth
that

cheating

wooed

they

and

In
one
sense
,
this
limits
him

unlike
a
writer
such
as
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez
,
who
has
a
distinctive
Latin
voice
,
Mr.
Mahfouz
's
style
offers
little
that
can
be
labeled
``
Egyptian

Mr.

pilloried

questioning

While

the

here

of
its

Emergency
measures
would
be
introduced
to
ease
the

financial

its

The
blueprint
is
at
its
vaguest
when
referring
to
the
fate
of
the
two
powerful
economic
institutions
that
seem
likely
to
oppose
such
sweeping
plans

the

But
most
U.S.

have

rushed
to
change
the
way
they

they

the

by
a

MGM

The

,
with
its
marble
fountains
and
toga
parties
for
high
rollers
,
is
already
well
-
known
for
its
Caesarean
theme
.

For
now
,
however
,
the
naysayers
'
voices
are
drowned
by
the
roar
of
cement
mixers
and
the
clanging
of
construction
cranes
along
the
Strip
.

Only
now
is
it
undergoing
a
badly
needed
facelift
.

Despite
the
proliferation
of

distractions
,
Las

have
n't
forgot
that
gambling
is
still
what
the

all
about

After
all
,
this
is
the
industry
that
has
a
hard
enough
time
getting
any
respect
,
that
is
the
butt
of
so
many

portrays

as
short

unremittingly
boring

The

,
ever
optimistic
,
are
looking
for
ways
around
the
problem
.

of
a
boring

--
and
a

of
colorful

with
which
readers
can
dress
it
up
.

It
involved
the
athletics

That
disclosure
came
,
a
Delmed

said
,
after
the
American
Stock

alerted
the
company
that
trading
would
n't
resume

about

was

It
added
that
no

But
although

many

The

but
the
network
has
some
big
names
to
contend
with
,
too
.

In
his
review
of

Chung
,
''
Tom
Shales
,
the
TV
critic
of
the
Washington

generally
an

wrote
that
while
the

is
``
impressive

...
one
has
to
wonder
if

the
proper
direction

Mr.
Lieber
,
the
actor
who
plays
Mr.
Hoffman
,
says
he
was
concerned
at
first
that
the
script
would
``
misrepresent
an
astute
political
mind
,
one
that
I
admired
,
''
but
that
his
concerns
were
allayed
.

``
It
's
a
seller
's
market
,
''
said
Mr.
Snedeker
of
the
reinsurance
market
right
now
.

Some
senior
advisers
argue
that
with
further
fights
over
a
capital
-
gains
tax
cut
and
a
budget
-
reduction
bill
looming
,
Mr.
Bush
already
has
enough
pending
confrontations
with
Congress
.

If
a
president
had
a
line
-
item
veto
and
wanted
to
force
him
to
support
a
controversial
foreign
-
policy
initiative
,
Rep.
Edwards
says
,
the
president
could
call
and
declare
that
he
would
single
-
handedly
kill
the
BART
funds
unless
the
congressman
``
shapes
up
''
on
the
foreign

policy
issue
.

Moreover
,
in
the
relatively
unregulated
Indian
stock
markets
,
investors
frequently
do
n't
know
what
they
are
getting
when
they
subscribe
to
an
issue
.

India
's
overregulated
businessmen
had
to
be
persuaded
,
but
they
have
started
to
think
big
.

But
now
,
with
large
amounts
being
raised
from
investors
,
the
government
's
dawdling
on
regulation
and
disclosure
requirements
has
a
more
dangerous
aspect
.

Because
of
the
large
amounts
of
money
being
raised
,
the
loose
disclosure
requirements
and
the
casual
monitoring
of
how
the
money
is
used
,
some
analysts
fear
that
there
could
be
a
few
mega-crashes
,
which
could
hurt
market
confidence
far
more
than
the
small
bankruptcies
that
followed
the
boom
of
1986
.

And
today
,
many
of
their
children

grandchildren

Mr.

based

:
``
One

In

,

it

that
Mr.

have
unwittingly
served

moral
victory
on

can
now
traipse
the

condemning
the
whole

a
belief
that
rents
have
not

hit
bottom

The
trend
toward
lower
rents
may
seem
surprising
given
that
some
communities
in

are
bemoaning
the
loss
of
favorite

In

of

a

a

of

economic
indicators
,
British
Chancellor

promised
gradual

in

Discussing

in

,
the

stated
that

To
build
a

egg
that
would
pay
for

just
down

where
about

Larry

has
acquired
two
retail

broadened
his

expanded

Two

later

he
opened

Since

he
has
expanded

can
now

their

also
recommended
approval

He
expects
real

2.1

noting
a
wider
trade

the
lower

figures
.

that

But
further
major
advances
on

n't
foreseen
this

Dealers
said
the
day

action
was
featureless
outside
some
response
to
sterling
's
early
weakness
against

,
and
fears
that

open
lower

How
does
a

famous
for
its
high

end
up
as

haven
for
low

``
I

heard
that
there

40

Mr.

``
It
's
amazing
the

in

Mr.

says

have
the

''
Mr.
Mattausch
added
,
``
and
that
means
virtually
everyone
who
works
here

Having
said
that
,
we
must
caution
against
an
apparent

overstate
the

WEIRTON

said
it
completed

For
instance
,
some
investors
have
sworn
off
stocks
since
the
1987
market
crash
;
last
Friday
's
debacle
only
reinforced
those
feelings
.

Of
course
,
the
greater
volatility
of
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
does
n't
necessarily
mean
those
investments
are
riskier
in
terms
of
meeting
the
holders

long

term
goals
.

What
makes
a
person
buy
an
oil
well
from
some
stranger
knocking
on
the
screen
door
?

So
one
popular
ploy
is
to
make
a
prospective
investor
feel
like
an
insider
,
joining
an
exclusive
group
that
is
about
to
make
a
killing
.

When
he
visited
the
company
's
office
,
he
says
,
it
had
``
all
the
trappings
of
legitimacy
.
''

``
Sometimes
when
people
are
making
big
changes
,
retiring
from
their
jobs
,
moving
to
a
new
area
,
they
lose
their
bearings

In

shrank
to
8.7
%
after
ranging
between
9
%
and
11
%
for
much
of
the
previous
year
.

Now
we
are
starting
to
see
real
freight

rate
increases
as
carriers
replace
equipment
,
pay
higher
fuel

IN
SIZING
UP
the
risks
of
stock

investments
,
there
's
probably
no
starting

better
than
``
beta
.
''

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Lep
Group
said
a
possible
course
of
action
may
include
acquiring
some
or
all
of
the
Profit
Systems
shares
it
does
n't
already
own
.

The
gain
compared
with
a
$
1.10
billion
decline
in
reserve
assets
in
August
to
$
62.36
billion
,
the

said
.

If
all
you
want
is
death
-
benefit
coverage
,
pure
insurance
--
a
term
policy
--
gives
you
maximum
bang
for
your
buck
,
within
limits
.

The
word
``
death
''
can
not
be
escaped
entirely
by
the
industry
,
but
salesmen
dodge
it
wherever
possible
or
cloak
it
in
euphemisms
,
preferring
to
talk
about
``
savings
''
and
``
investment
''
instead
.

Projecting
the
latter
over
several
decades
,
I
find
my
cash
buildup
is
impressive
--
but
can
any
high
interest
rate
prevail
for
that
long
?

And
considering
the
extra
cost
of
such
provisions
,
some
figure
that
people
interested
in
,
say
,
paying
for
extended
nursing
-
home
care
would
be
better
off
just
buying
a
separate
policy
that
provides
it
.

Yet
if

prices
improve

could
rally
sharply

Some
analysts
say
Noranda
would
prefer
to
break
up
Falconbridge
,
and
that
the
Swedes
--
relatively
inexperienced
in
international
mining
operations
--
could
have
problems
holding
their
own

a
much
bigger
partner

At
the

time

he
remains
fairly
pessimistic
about
the
outlook
for

says
Mr.

,
adding
that
the

Since

Jones
.

However
,
the
disclosure
of
the
guidelines
,
first
reported
last
night
by
NBC
News
,
is
already
being
interpreted
on
Capitol
Hill
as
an
unfair
effort
to
pressure
Congress
.

Last
week
,
Central
Intelligence
Agency
Director
William
Webster
publicly
called
on
Congress
to
provide
new
interpretations
of
the
assassination
order
that
would
permit
the
U.S.
more
freedom
to
act
in
coups
.

The
existence
of
the
policy
became
known
after
Bush
disclosed
it
to
seven
GOP
senators
last
week
,
citing
the
plan
as
an
example
of
congressional
requirements
the
administration
contends
contribute
to
the
failure
of
covert
actions
,
officials
said
.

The
incident
occurred
Saturday
night
.

The
adjustments
reflect
the
increase
in
the
consumer
price
index
for
urban
wage
earners
and
clerical
workers
from
the
third
quarter
of
last
year
to
the

of
this

But
some
members
of
an
ad
hoc
expert
committee
set
up
by
the
Department
of
Energy
to
evaluate
the
cold
fusion
research
were
in
the
audience
.

Mr.
Oriani
said
the
heat
bursts
were
too
large
and
too
long
to
be
explained
by
the
sudden
release
of
energy
that
might
have
slowly
accumulated
during
the
experiments
'
quiescent
times
,
as
some
scientists
have
suggested
.

did
n't
believe
that
the
Rubins
,
who
earned
$
65,619
in
their
regular
jobs
,
treated
the
sideline
as
a
real
business
and
derived
``
merely
incidental
elements
of
recreation
and
other
personal
pleasure
and
benefits
''
from
it
.

Perhaps
most
dramatic
was
the
performance
of
the

,
which
was
booming
until
I
entered
it
in
late
1988
,
at
which
time
it
posted
the
first
negative
compound
annual
growth
rate
in

.

With
this
personal

firmly
in

it
raised

.

Moreover
,
it
says
the
RTC
's
total
obligations
may
not
exceed
$
50
billion
,
but
that
figure
is
derived
after
including
notes
and
other

,
and
subtracting
from
it
the
market
value
of
the
assets
the
RTC
holds
.

The

Just
days
after

major

rushed

able
to
gear
up
quickly
thanks

whether
their

will
be

By

the

the

,
whose
troubles
had
kicked
off
Friday
's

,
still
had
n't
opened
.

Foreign
stock
markets
,
which
kicked
off
Black

with

huge

spree
,
began
the
day
off
by
relatively
modest
amounts
.

London

stock

turned
up
just
before
8

New

,
sending
an
encouraging
message
to
Wall

.

German
and
Dutch
investors
reportedly
loaded
up
on
Kellogg
Co
.

Instead
,
the
rally
only
paused
for
about
25
minutes
and
then
steamed
forward
as

resumed
buying

All
eyes
were
on
Tokyo
at
the
opening
because
it
was
the
first
major
market
to
trade
since
Friday
's
190.58

point
plunge
on
Wall
Street
.

This
time
,
Wall
Street
's
plunge
of
6.9
%
Friday
was
followed
by
yesterday
's
1.8
%
loss
in
Tokyo
.

Several
analysts
said
Malaysia
and
Singapore
had
the
biggest
losses
because
they
are
relatively
open
to
rapid
cash
flows
.

Analysts
cited
memories
of
two
years
ago
,
when
many
small
investors
held
on
to
their
shares
after
the
October
crash
but
the
West
German
market
continued
to
decline
steeply
for
the
next
three
months
.

key
here

is
about
1.6

are

A

:
Declining

975
to
749
,
and
the

They
did
n't
.

Not
like
Friday
where
they
just
took

apart

Specialists
were
criticized
for
their
inability
to
maintain
orderly
markets
during
the
Friday
plunge
.

``
Obviously
,
every
time
we
get
this
kind
of
reaction
,
it
's
going
to
make
everybody
nervous
,
including
me
,
''
he
said
.

Trading
in
cotton

And
before
the
opening
of
trading
here
yesterday
,
all
eyes
were
on
early
trading
in
Tokyo
for
a
clue
as
to
how
widespread
the
fallout
might
be
.

``
When
I
want
to
buy
,
they
run
from
you
--
they
keep
changing
their
prices
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

Suddenly
,
after
about
45
minutes
,
the
U.S.
markets
rallied
.

The
ceremonies
began
Friday
afternoon
when
word
spread
that
the
UAL
buy
-
out
was
collapsing
.

After
all
,
the
stock
market
's
response
to
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
might
be
taken
to
confirm
the
anti-debt
direction
of
regulators
.

By
a
6

4
margin
,
House
negotiators
initially
rejected
last

all

Congress
previously
cut
six
airports
this

After
the
1987
plunge
,
markets
agreed
that
it
would
be
wise
to
halt
trading
whenever
panic
conditions
arose
.

Synchronized
circuit
breakers
would
not
have
halted
the
slide
in
prices
on
Friday
,
but
they
probably
would
have
made
for
smoother
,
less
volatile
executions
.

British
Prime

Tony

yesterday
ignited
an
already
fiery
controversy
on
religious
tolerance
and

conformity
in

when
he

Lebanon

Around
19
Bulgarians

have
died

the
man
did
not
last
in

more
than
one
term

,
and
when
he
began
to
understand
the
truth
of
the
conflict
in
the
region
,
he
lost
the
presidential
elections
.

These
statements
provoked
mixed
reactions
from
German
politicians

meeting
strong
rejection
from
some
politicians

including
leaders
of

Asia
encountered
financial
turmoil
and
have
had
some
difficulties
in
their
economic
development
,
but
the
economic
basis
of

is
still
good
and
advantageous
factors

The

actively
introducing
foreign
capital
,
technology
and
management
experience
,
it
accelerated
the
development
and
utilization
of
China
's
limited
oil
and
natural
gas
resources
in
order
to
make
it
meet
the
developing
needs
of
China
's
national
economy
.

China
's
processing
trade
was
mainly
developed
from
the
transfer
of
labor
-
intensive
manufacturing
industries
or
work
processes
from
developed
countries
such
as
the
US
,
Japan
,
etc.
and
countries
and
regions
such
as
Singapore
,
Korea
,
Hong
Kong
,
Taiwan
,
etc.
,
in
order
to
reduce
production
costs
and
raise
competitiveness
.

These
"
three
do
not
fears
"
are
a
demonstration
of
the
spirit
of
communism
.

According
to
official
journals
published
recently
by
Mexico
's
Treasury
Department
,
Mexico
's
foreign
trade
in
1997
continued
to
grow
rapidly
,
the
total
amount
of
imports
and
exports
reached
220.178
billion
US
dollars
,
18.85
%
higher
than
that
of
the
previous
year
,
and
within
that
the
amount
of
exports
was
110.380
billion
US
dollars
,
the
amount
of
imports
was
109.798
billion
US
dollars
,
15
%
and
22.7
%
higher
than
1996
,
respectively
.

Under
these
circumstances
,
if
the
import
growth
momentum
can
not
be
restrained
,
this
year
,
a
trade
deficit
of
4
to
5
billion
US
dollars
may
appear
.

Reviewing
the
development
over
these
15
years
of
China
's
domestic
institutions
issuing
overseas
debt
,
it
has
fundamentally
been
successful
,
from
the
nation
's
macro
management
to
the
micro
operation
of
every
loan
transaction
.

Currently
,
France
has
1200
soldiers
stationed
in
Chad

The
principle
of
"
invigorating
large
enterprises
while
relaxing
control
over
small
ones
"
has
been
strengthened
.

It
was
plotted
deliberately
by
recalcitrant
factions
of
the
Nationalist
Party
while
the
Chinese
race
was
at
a
dangerous
point
of
life
and
death
.

The
delta
region
's
Quanzhou
,
over
the
past
5
years
,
has
had
a
GNP
that
annually
increases
42.9
%
,
and
3
cities
under
its
administration
,
namely
Jinjiang

have
ascended

in
the

presented
that
Tianjin
has

Under
the
planned
economy
system
,
FAW
was
a
"
factory
"
to
complete
directive
tasks
of
the
nation
,
but
now
FAW
is
a
large
-
scale
automobile
enterprise
group
possessing
functionalities
such
as
development
,
production
,
marketing
,
financing
and
foreign
economy
and
trade
,
etc
.

The
key
of
the
current
economy
is
not
striving
for
a
higher
growth
rate
,
but
is
adjusting
structures
and
increasing
benefits
so
as
to
make
macro
controls
which
were
implemented
from
the
second
half
year
of
1993
obtain
greater
achievements
and
push
the
national
economy
onto
a
road
of
constant
,
rapid
and
healthy
development
.

According
to
what
officials
from
China
's
National
Development
Bank
revealed
,
by
the
end
of
last
year
,
the
bank
has
provided
financing
of
foreign
exchange
for
24
national
key
projects
totally
,
among
which
18
have
finished
the
signing
contracts
,
with
a
total
foreign
contracted
amount
of
about
3.4
billion
US
dollars
.

In
February
of
1983
,
the
Central
Committee
of
the
CCP
and
the
State
Council
decided
to
put
Chongqing
in
the
first
group
of
experimental
cities
of
economic
structural
reform
and
cities
implementing
a
separate
classification
planning
system
,
to
grant
provincial
-
level
economic
management
authority
,
and
to
open
it
up
as
a
foreign
trade
port
.

According
to
statistics
,
the
successive
launch
of
operations
of
the
145,000
foreign
invested
enterprises
,
the
number
of
direct
job
holders
reached
17.5
million
,
whereas
foreign
staff
are
only
a
few
hundred
thousand
people
.

Additionally
,
China
,
in
recent
years
also
introduced
a
production
line
of
pre-separating
kilns
,
constructed
large
scale
modernized
cement
corporations
such
as
Jidong
,
Ningguo
,
Huaihai
,
Liuzhou
,
etc.
,
and
has
recently
increased
annual
production
capability
of
22
million
tons
of
cement
.

These
projects
powerfully
bring
about
optimization
and
improvement
of
Shandong
Province
's
industrial
structure
.

He
said
that
the
political
situation
in
China
was
a
stable
one
and
the
economy
also
was
steadily
developing
.

We
hope
that
such
cooperation
will
develop
uninterruptedly
and
yield
plentiful
and
substantial
fruit
.
