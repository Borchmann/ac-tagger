Justice
Liu
Tieh
-
cheng
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
noted
that
appropriations
are
listed
in
the
ROC
Constitution
together
with
legislative
bills
and
treaty
ratification
bills
,
and
argued
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
way
.

The
justices
ruled
that
the
decision
making
process
violated
the
National
Assembly
's
rules
of
order
and
went
against
the
principle
that
all
decisions
must
be
open
and
transparent
.

What
exactly
is
at
the
heart
of
these
disputes
?

And
among
the
100
largest
domestic
companies
,
more
than
70
are
registered
in
the
city
and
pay
their
business
taxes
there
.

When
the
ROC
took
over
,
government
power
returned
to
the
Governor
-
General
's
Residence
in
Taipei
,
which
became
the
Presidential
Palace
.

Many
businesses
were
privately
expecting
that
the
Port
of
Taichung
would
be
able
to
establish
direct
shipping
links
with
the
mainland
,
and
were
even
hoping
to
attract
"
red
capital
"
from
across
the
strait
.

"
If
you
really
want
to
help
those
cities
and
counties
,
then
you
've
got
to
implement
'
local
self
-
rule
,
'
so
that
the
local
governments
-LRB-
which
are
now
only
tertiary
government
units
-RRB-
really
acquire
sufficient
power
and
money
,

About
10,000
of
these
foreign
domestics
leave
every
year
when
their
contracts
expire

Recently
,
there
has
been
a
big
controversy
about
which
romanization
system
to
use
for
writing
Chinese
characters
in
English
.

The
year
that
he
lost
,
Chen
magnanimously
said
,
"
a
first
-
rate
city
is
bound
to
be
a
very
picky
city
.
"

He
has
seen
a
syndrome
play
out
there
:
people
's
parents
die
,
and
then
they
sell
their
farmland
,
let
their
family
home
go
to
ruin
,
pull
up
their
stakes
and
move
to
Taipei
.

The
element
of
the
Taiwan
experience
that
is
most
worthy
of
the
nation
's
pride
is
the
relatively
even
distribution
of
wealth
and
resources
.

Taipei
,
on
the
other
hand
,
ca
n't
even
get
along
with
Taipei
County
,
which
completely
surrounds
it
.

Some
were
highly
optimistic
,
others
were
guardedly
optimistic
,
and
a
third
group
argued
that
the
crystal
ball
has
gone
cloudy
.

emphasized

And
yes
,
once
again
,
it
is
true
that
the
Chinese
Communists
have
muted
their
rhetoric
considerably
.

It
appears
that
the
people
of
Taiwan
have
finally
taken
their
first
bold
step
into
an
era
of
true
democracy
,

Although
we
do
n't
know
where
we
're
going
,
it
is
our
journey
.

The
Maneki
Neko
has
ridden
a
wave
of
fashion
for
things
Japanese
to
superstardom
in
Taiwan
,
and
its
sales
have
n't
suffered
a
whit
with
the
slumping
economy
.

According
to
legend
,
a
Daoist
master
named
Liu
Hai
and
a
three
-
legged
golden
toad
scattered
gold
coins
across
the
land
.

Moreover
,
the
potbellied
Buddha
by
himself
is
still
a
popular
motif
for
china
,
as
well
as
for
jade
and
wood
carvings
.

As
a
consequence
,
his
flower
-
arranging
business
has
likewise
shriveled
.

While
the
falling
stock
market
has
meant
that
aquarium
sellers
have
had
to
lower
their
prices
,
they
have
found
no
shortage
of
customers
willing
to
take
advantage
of
these
bargains
.

Those
who
habitually
get
their

told
are
naturally
given
to
installing
a

moment
and
positioning
a

More
than
a

Advanced
training
for
professionals
has
become
a
hot
topic
among
executives
over
the
past
two
years
,
but
continuing
education
is
nothing

among
Taiwan

universities

Even

leaving

no
different
from

the

Mark

khy
Tang
,
professor
in
the
Department

Judging
from
the
manner
in
which
universities
are
opening
their
doors
for
continuing
education
,
non-degree
programs
,
and
professional
training
,
higher
education
in
Taiwan
appears
to
be
undergoing
a
sort
of
makeover
.

As
for
tuition

,
Wu
Se

Hwa
relates
that
with
an

budget
of

200,000

but
we
all
knew
that

,
it

The
opening
ceremony
on
October
18
was
in
the
form
of
a
welcoming
for
aboriginal
elders
.

Chiang
,
a
member
of
the
Bunun
indigenous
people
,
received
a
traditional
hero
's
welcome
home
from
the
Bunun
of
Sanmin
Rural

in
Kaohsiung
County
.

These

are

or
are
diluted

Does
aromatherapy
really
work
?

But
against
the
backdrop
of
continued
proclamations
from
the
PRC
about
how
"
Macau
's
'
one
country
two
systems
'
arrangement
sets
an
example
for
solving
the
Taiwan
problem
,
"
these
figures
,
along
with
the
Taiwan
-
Macau
exchanges
that
they
represent
,
have
been
willfully
neglected
by
Macau
's
mainstream
media
.

At
present
,
the
most
senior
government
official
to
have
studied
in
Taiwan
is
Ou
Wenlong
,
who
graduated
in
mechanical
engineering
at
National
Taiwan
University
-LRB-
NTU
-RRB-
.

In
1966
,
Macau
was
convulsed
by
rioting
in
which
several
people
were
shot
and
killed
by
Portuguese
security
forces
.

Unlike
neighboring
Hong
Kong
in
1997
,
there
was
no
public
backlash
in
Macau
on
the
occasion
of
the
handover
,
and
no
exodus
of
emigrants
.

But
Tan
Zhiqiang
,
himself
a
returned
alumni
,
points
out
while
it
's
fine
having
dinner
together
,
if
it
ever
came
to
it
,
none
of
the
alumni
would
want
to
actively
"
align
"
themselves
with
Taiwan
,
given
the
pro-Beijing
political
climate
in
Macau
.

But
when
he
found
that
his
elementary
-
school
-
age
grandson
was
speaking
Cantonese
all
day
he
quickly
sent
him
back
to
school
in
Taiwan
,
fearing
that
the
boy
was
losing
his
mother
tongue
.

As
Gary
Mei
points
out
,
the
enclave
was
opened
to
the
outside
world
more
than
300
years
before
Hong
Kong
.

In
the
realm
of
politics
,
suggests
Wong
Hon
Keong
,
Macau
can
also
serve
as
a
"
catalyst
and
lubricant
for
relations
across
the
Taiwan
Strait
.

Pinglin
,

Really
,
not
one
.

The
proprietor
,
Mr.
Chen
,
has
been
associated
with
tea
since
he
was
very
young
:
"
I
never
got
very
far
in
school
,
so
the
best
thing
is
to
keep
on
growing
tea
.
"

When
someone
does
n't
do
as
well
as
they
had
hoped
in
a
tea
competition
,
they
try
to
figure
out
why
their
tea
did
n't
match
up
with
that
of
other
growers
.

Speaking
of
the
assaults
they
face
with
the
opening
of
the
market
,
the
township
chief
knits
his
brows
tightly
,

So
,
next
time
you
go
to
Pinglin
,
please
do
n't
just
treat
it
as
a
quick
pitstop
.

One
of
the
great
pleasures
of
a
visit
to
Pinglin
is
to
sample
teas
,
enjoy
all
kinds
of
tea
pastries
and
refreshments
,
and
watch
the
local
proprietors
make
tea
.

Probably
most
people
do
n't
realize
,
adds
Tsung
-
sheng
,
that
there
are
still
places
in
Taiwan
as
backward
as
Taihsi
.

The
second
indignity
was
the
onerous
taxes
that
were
levied
in
the
early
years
after
Taiwan
returned
to
Chinese
rule
.

Grandma
Wu
was
adopted
into
the
Wu
family
at
age
ten
.

Buildings
were
going
up
everywhere
in
Taipei
in
the
mid-1950s
,
and
the
city
was
bursting
with
opportunities
.

The
three
brothers
have
worked
together
over
the
years
to
build
up
their
businesses
,
and
an
efficient
division
of
labor
has
evolved
among
them
.

We
were
worried
that
they
might
fall
in
with
the
wrong
crowd
after
they
got
into
junior
high
,
"
says
Mrs.
Wu
,
adding
that
Taihsi
is
well
known
for
the
fact
that
it
has
"
lots
of
dust
in
the
air
,
lots
of
yams
,
and
lots
of
gangsters
.
"

Their
studies
ended
up
weakening
their
ties
to
their
hometown
,
notes
Tsung
-
sheng
wistfully
.

At
most
,
they
express
nostalgia
for
the
days
when
former
general
Hau
Pei
-
tsun
served
as
premier
,
because
"
they
arrested
a
lot
of
criminals
when
he
was
in
charge
.
"

Fifty
years
of
struggle
have
brought
prosperity
to
our
island
.

The
slow
-
paced
small
town
atmosphere
lingers
in
the
mind
long
after
a
visit
to
Taihsi
has
ended
.

Art
engineering
?

Each
of
these
men
was
at
the
forefront
of
his
field
in
Taiwan
,
and
their
deaths
represent
the
end
of
an
era
.

After
Taiwan
was
returned
to
Chinese
rule
,
Chang
returned
to
the
land
of
his
roots
.

Born
in
1931
in
Taoyuan
,
Tai
was
educated
under
Japanese
colonial
rule
,
and
he
earned
a
doctorate
in
agriculture
at
Tokyo
.

The
latter
suggests
that
some
people
have
allowed
blind
ambition
to
sully
the
pure
ideal
of
scholarship
.

Recently
the
8:00
p.m.
serials
being
shown
on
television
in
Taiwan
have
shown
a
trend
toward
"
Taiwanization
.
"

This
is
not
because
Taiwanese
are
especially
firm
believers
in
corporal
punishment
.

Moreover
,
because
of
opposition
from
high
officials
at
the
television
network
,
after
several
episodes
,
the
performers
who
had
previously
spoken
in
Taiwanese
had
their
dialogue
changed
to
"
Mandarin
with
a
Taiwanese
accent
.
"

Taiwanese
was
no
longer
taboo
,
and
indeed
identification
with
"
Taiwanese-ness
"
came
to
be
highly
admired
.

"
By
playing
on
people
's
heart
strings
,
using
Taiwanese
language
,
and
being
set
against
the
background
of
that
bitter
era
,
the
daughter
-
in
-
law
series
brought
together
all
the
traditional
elements
of
the
Taiwanese
drama
,
but
in
addition
added
new
structure
and
packaging
,
and
integrated
the
spiciness
and
conflict
typical
of
an
8:00
show
.

This
format
incorporates
the
rural
themes
of
traditional
Taiwanese
drama
,
but
the
stories
evolve
with
time
,
and
also
portray
modern
urban
life
.

ON
programming

If
the
station
strategy
is
set
up
that
way
,
it
's
unlikely
they
will
change
.

Japanese
TV
relies
mostly
on
packaging
of
well
-
known
"
idols
,
"
with
most
of
the
effort
going
into
the
aesthetics
of
presentation
,
and
little
emphasis
on
storyline
.

So
-
called
"
ON
programming
"
-
meaning
that
series
episodes
are
shot
right
before
the
time
of
broadcast
-
is
a
special
feature
of
Taiwan
's
prime
-
time
televised
serials
.

When
you
think
of
Shanghai
,
what
comes
to
mind
?

Buildings
owned
by
the
state
are
called
gong
fang

or
"
public
buildings
.

Single
men
practically
shout
it
out
:
"
My
girlfriend
is
in
Shanghai

You
have
to
know
how
to
operate
under
the
table
.

The
17
warriors
now
on
display
at
the
National
Museum
of
History
represent
the
largest
contingent
from
the
ancient
tomb
ever
to
travel
on
loan
outside
of
mainland
China
.

It
was
n't
long
before
archeologists
were
swarming
over
the
site
,
unearthing
an
army
of
terracotta
warriors
that
had
lain
buried
for
over
2,000
years
.

Indeed
,
there
are
people
who
subscribe
to
the
rumor
that
each
clay
figure
encloses
the
corpse
of
a
real
person
.

I
wonder
if
we
can
even
do
anything
that
nice
today
?
"

Or
were
the
artisans
simply
exaggerating
?

They
say
it
's
tough
to
try
and
raise
children
as
an
expatriate
,
and
I
can
sure
attest
to
that
.
"

Then
go
on
to
give
them
your
own
views

The
school
will
begin
admitting
students
this
coming
September
and
start
classes
in
October
.

In
addition
to
Taiwanese
teaching
materials
,
she
has
also
incorporated
some
materials
from
the
mainland
and
overseas
into
the
curriculum
.

"
It
's
all
the
more
difficult
,
"
notes
Huang
frankly
,
"
to
hold
on
to
teachers
from
Taiwan
,
who
ca
n't
help
but
compare
their
situation
here
with
what
they
are
accustomed
to
in
Taiwan
.
"

It
is
also
exciting
to
look
forward
to
the
founding
of
a
school
for
the
Taiwanese
business
community
.

foundation
.

Leaders
of
our
friendly
nations
,
distinguished
guests
and
compatriots
from
Taiwan
and
abroad
;

The
new
century
's
gates
of
hope
are
soon
to
open
.

They
are
also
Taiwan
's
key
to
stepping
over
its
fault
lines
and
rising
to
a
higher
level
in
the
future
.

Whether
in
the
east
,
west
,
north
or
south
,
whether
on
Taiwan
proper
or
on
offshore
islands
,
all
will
enjoy
balanced
,
pluralistic
development
,
and
the
gap
between
urban
and
rural
areas
will
be
reduced
.

An
impartial
,
independent
judiciary
is
a
protector
of
social
order
and
a
defender
of
the
people
's
rights
.

Our
compatriots
have
been
injured
by
the
September
21
earthquake
,
but
with
the
spirit
of
a
"
volunteer
Taiwan
,
"
Taiwan
's
new
family
will
stand
up
resolutely
on
its
feet
once
again
.

Today
,
as
the
Cold
War
has
ended
,
it
is
time
for
the
two
sides
to
cast
aside
the
hostility
left
from
the
old
era
.

Only
by
adhering
to
the
will
of
the
people
can
we
pioneer
the
paths
of
history
and
build
enduring
architecture
.

Foreign
guests
attended
the
inauguration
in
large
numbers
.

Tsai
acknowledges
that
because
of
the
immediacy
of
the
medium
his
online
work
is
to
some
degree
influenced
,
in
terms
of
form
,
content
and
progress
,
by
the
response
of
the
readers
-
"
even
if
a
lot
of
that
influence
is
unconscious
.
"

On
the
other
hand
,
Shuang
-
tzu
,
who
graduated
in
Chinese
literature
from
Hua
Fan
University
,
does
have
literary
ambitions
.

This
remnant
of
virgin
cypress
forest
runs
northward
to
Taoyuan
County
's
Mt.
Lala
and
to
Chilan
in
Ilan
County
.

Doughty
false
cypress
seeds
seized
the
opportunity
to
colonize
this
hostile
territory
shunned
by
other
plants
.

After
Taiwan
's
return
to
Chinese
rule
,
from
the
1950s
to
the
1980s
the
ROC
used
forestry
income
to
support
its
industrial
development
.

But
tough
as
these
woods
are
,
the
sleepers
only
stood
up
to
three
to
five
years
of
logging
trains
rumbling
over
them
,
so
there
was
no
choice
but
to
change
them
all
for
sleepers
made
of
false
cypress
wood
,
which
lasted
for
decades
.

With
forestry
earning
no
profits
,
and
in
response
to
energetic
lobbying
by
civic
groups
,
the
Executive
Yuan
finally
banned
the
cutting
of
natural
forests
,
at
last
giving
a
respite
to
the
giant
trees
which
protect
Taiwan
's
land
.

Only
if
we
can
allow
the
cypress
trees
a
future
,
will
the
people
of
Taiwan
also
have
a
lasting
future
.

The
incident
frightened
her
so
badly
that
she
would
n't
let
her
daughter
go
back
to
school
.

Later
Martine
told
my
wife
that
I
had
had
to
leave
unless
I
wanted
to
spend
my
entire
life
holding
Chien
-
chien
's
hand
.

When
the
weather
turned
cool
and
Chien
-
chien
came
down
with
a
fever
,
Martine
called
my
wife
to
offer
to
keep
Chien
-
chien
for
the
night
.

Now
the
Democratic
Progressive
Party
-LRB-
DPP
-RRB-
,
with
which
the
Chinese
Communist
Party
has
no
historical
relationship
,
is
the
ruling
party
.

This
July
,
a
book
published
by
the
PRC
entitled
Chinese
Foreign
Policy
,
the
Year
2000
,
declared
that
its
most
important
foreign
policy
goal
is
to
"
reunify
the
country
,
"
and
strongly
attacked
Taiwan
's
efforts
to
be
admitted
to
the
United
Nations
.

Formal
diplomatic
partners

What
is
so
important
about
financial
assistance
that
both
the
old
and
the
new
administrations
place
such
emphasis
on
it
?

However
,
because
the
PRC
has
no
formal
diplomatic
relations
with
Costa
Rica
,
they
would
have
to
add
a
40
%
customs
tax
.

In
this
age
of
the
global
village
,
international
organizations
are
increasingly
important
.

That
being
the
case
,
so
far
,
how
has
the
new
foreign
policy
team
been
doing
?

Though
in
office
for
less
than
four
months
,
foreign
minister
Tien
Hung
-
mao
has
already
been
to
Europe
twice
.

King
of
Taiwan
's
Snakes

Other
Taiwanese
aboriginal
peoples
with
a
close
relationship
to
the
hundred
-
pacer
are
the
Bunun
and
the
Rukai
.

Lavuras
recalls
that
the
largest
numbers
of
hundred
-
pace
vipers
were
caught
in
the
period
from
the
1960s
to
the
1980s
.

Although
it
is
an
endangered
species
,
lack
of
detailed
information
about
such
things
as
its
reproductive
cycle
,
preferred
prey
,
range
of
activity
and
habits
turns
conservation
efforts
into
little
more
than
empty
talk
.

Lavuras
asked
the
scholars
bluntly
where
they
had
seen
hundred
-
pacers
.

Their
faces
reveal
a
moving
strength
and
mettle
drawn
from
nature
.

He
was
,
however
,
extremely
anxious
to
save
the
results
of
ethnological
fieldwork
going
back
nearly
two
decades
.

Teng
picked
up
a
lot
of
valuable
fieldwork
techniques
by
watching
Professor
Wei
interview
the
old
folks
.

According
to
Hsu
Mu
-
chu
,
a
researcher
at
Academia
Sinica
's
Institute
of
Ethnology
,
"
Teng
Hsiang
-
yang
's
status
as
a
member
of
the
medical
community
and
his
wide
contacts
among
the
aborigines
enabled
him
to
make
a
key
contribution
to
the
research
project
.
"

His
grandfather
and
grandmother
were
survivors
of
the
Wushe
Incident
,
but
they
had
always
been
unwilling
to
talk
about
the
past
.

"
If
we
are
the
Atayal
nation
,
then
he
is
an
honorary
member
of
the
Sediq
.
"

One
of
his
friends
,
the
highly
successful
nonfiction
writer
Liao
Chia
-
chan
,
had
only
gotten
five
minutes
into
the
book
before
exclaiming
,
"
This
is
going
to
win
literary
prizes
!
"

"
I
tried
to
write
in
New
Zealand
,
but
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
the
easy
life
or
the
distance
.

I
used
to
cry
every
time
I
talked
about
this
wonderful
doctor
,
but
I
'm
getting
a
little
less
emotional
about
it
as
time
goes
by
.

Teng
Hsiang
-
yang
can
often
be
found
at
festivals
and
ceremonies
of
the
Thao
tribe
,
who
have
come
to
regard
him
as
one
of
their
own
.

The
following
cases
,
currently
under
investigation
,
have
attracted
particular
attention
:
the
alleged
involvement
of
Linkou
mayor
Tsai
Tzung
-
yi
,
Yingko
Township
chief
Hsu
Yuan
-
ho
and
Linkou
council
deputy
chairman
Chou
Yeh

in
the
operation
of
an
illegal
waste
dump
at
a
disused
brickyard
;
alleged
fraud
by
Nantou
County
commissioner
Peng
Pai
-
hsien
in
connection
with
construction
projects
;
allegations
of
corruption
against

and
the
suspected
embezzlement
of

Pali
:
Storied
Past
,
Uncertain
Future

Though
it
does
n't
have
much
of
a
hinterland
,
its
geographic
location
has
proved
historically
important
,
as
one
can
see
from
the
prehistoric
cultures
unearthed
at
the
Ta
-
pen
-
keng
and
Shih
-
san
-
hang
archeological
sites
.

In
accordance
with
the
urban
plan
,
new
streets
were
cut
this
way
and
that
through
Pali
's
land
,
and
high
-
rise
buildings
sprang
up
along
the
sides
of
these
roadways
.

People
say
the
fengshui
is
good
here
,
so
they
come
.
"

Thus
,
in
urban
plans
Pali
is
always
assigned
the
role
of
serving
Taipei
.

It
is
one
of
the
29
townships
under
the
jurisdiction
of
Taipei
County
.

"
Spring
Festival
,
"
as
it
is
known
,
brings
a
longer
break
from
work
-
compared
with
Western
New
Year
-
and
is
an
altogether
more
meaningful
occasion
for
the
Chinese
.

Slowly
warming
up

Lin
recalls
that
there
were
so
many
mouths
to
feed
at
New
Year
that
they
had
to
use
two
or
three
large
bamboo
steamers
to
make
the
puddings
.

In
the
Haifeng
area
of
Guangdong
Province
,
there
is
a
saying
to
describe
the
hardship
that
the
holiday
brings
for
the
poor
-
whom
the
festival
often
relieved
of
a
whole
year
's
worth
of
painstakingly
accumulated
surplus
:
"
Those
with
money
celebrate
New
Year
;
those
without
money
get
stripped
bare
.
"

A
bittersweet
evening

The
old
bruiser
,
nearly
80
years
old
,
was
struck
speechless
.

"
We
were
always
very
thrifty
in
those
days
,
without
extra
cash
for
new
things
.

"
It
's
nothing
to
do
with
money
,
"
she
stresses
.

"
New
Year
is
part
of
our
shared
cultural
and
ethnic
memory
.

How
can
one
win
in
the
investment
game
without
losing
the
game
of
life
in
the
process
?

For
example
,
a
child
in
her
early
teens
might
babysit
for
the
neighbors
or
cut
lawns
,
and
then
put
the
money
in
a
mutual
fund
.

At
that
time
,
the
stock
market
had
only
a
hundred
or
so
listed
companies
,
and
its
fate
depended
on
a
few
manipulators
behind
the
scenes
.

The
number
of
empty
units
rose
to
over
one
million
.

The
US
NASDAQ
index
,
which
has
a
history
of
29
years
behind
it
,
suddenly
surged
from
2800
in
October
of
last
year
to
more
than
5000
by
March
of
this
year
.

Last
year
,
one
of
the
hottest
stocks
was
Quanta
Computers
,
which
reached
800
per
share
.

As
Miss
Chen
does
not
hesitate
to
say
:
"
My
Mom
and
Dad
still
think
that
it
would
only
mean
an
extra
set
of
chopsticks
on
the
table
for
them
to
live
with
their
daughter
.

Chang
recalls
an
inexperienced
reporter
who
got
sucked
in
to
the
market
two
years
ago
by
some
irresistible
insider
information
.

Last
year
,
after
vacillating
for
quite
a
while
,
he
finally
borrowed
NT$
80,000
from
his
mother
to
invest
in
stocks
,
under
the
assumption
that
,
by
putting
to
use
what
he
was
learning
in
school
,
it
would
n't
be
that
hard
to
make
a
good
return
.

In
the
end
,
there
are
no
numbers
that
can
validly
measure
what
has
been
gained
in
life
,
and
what
lost
.

Here
are
a
few
suggestions
:

But
now
times
are
changing
so
fast
that
perhaps
the
lessons
of
past
experience
are
no
longer
suitable
for
solving
today
's
problems
.

This
is
the
time
of
life
when
the
doubts
set
in
.
"

4.
Realistically
strive
for
one
's
dreams

This
would
both
put
you
into
contact
with
other
people
and
help
you
gain
a
sense
of
accomplishment
.

"
Even
if
you
feel
uncertain
,
it
should
be
a
positive
feeling
of
uncertainty
.

Both
Kuomintang
presidential
candidate
Lien
Chan
and
Democratic
Progressive
Party
presidential
candidate
Chen
Shui
-
bian
have
commented
on
the
subject
.

If
Taiwan
does
not
respond
in
time
,
it
will
be
forced
into
an
increasingly
passive
position
.

But
this
may
not
be
feasible
,
says
Bih
Chung
-
ho
,
editor
-
in
-
chief
of
the
defense
magazine
Defense
Technology
Monthly
.

But
pure
defense
is
not
enough
.

According
to
the
Air
Force
,
this
problem
is
the
result
of
the
transition
period
to
a
new
generation
of
aircraft
.

The
same
applies
to
other
types
of
high
-
tech
material
.

The
military
is
currently
actively
studying
the
construction
of
information
war
capability
,
and
it
hopes
to
cooperate
with
the
private
sector
and
utilize
private
-
sector
computer
knowledge
to
jointly
deploy
an
electronics
defense
network
.

Pesus
Chou
,
executive
secretary
of
the
Human
Rights
Education
Foundation
,
says
that
this
year
a
further
list
of
180
victims
was
accepted
,
and
there
are
now
a
total
of
690
names
of
victims
of
political
persecution
engraved
on
the
wall
.

If
his
teacher
is
Chinese
,
the
probable
response
is
:
"
No
ambition
!

One
of
the
tales
in
the
Yuan
dynasty
work
24
Paragons
of
Filial
Piety
records
that
in
ancient
times
a
man
named
Guo
Ju
,
who
was
too
poor
to
keep
his
mother
properly
fed
,
proposed
to
his
wife
that
they
kill
their
three
-
year
-
old
son
-
since
he
was
consuming
a
share
of
the
old
lady
's
food
.

Now
he
feels
that
he
has
squandered
a
lot
of
time
because
of
vacillation
and
a
lack
of
clear
guidance
.

In
this
transitional
era
,
caught
between
East
and
West
,
traditional
and
modern
,
parents
have
to
be
ready
to
respond
to
new
challenges
all
the
time
.

A
final
version
of
Hsieh
's
findings
is
to
be
provided
to
the
investigating
authorities
.

Under
pressure
from
the
public
and
legislators
,
on
December
22
Minister
of
Finance
Chiu
announced
partial
results
of
their
investigation
,
as
mentioned
above
.

Having
dragged
on
since
27
October
last
year
,
the
furore
over
the
cancellation
of
the
Fourth
Nuclear
Power
Plant
project
was
briefly
laid
to
rest
on
13
February
2001
,
when
Premier
Chang
Chun
-
hsiung
and
Legislative
Yuan
speaker
Wang
Jin
-
pyng
signed
an
agreement
to
resume
construction
of
the
plant
.

In
view
of
projections
that
in
2005
northern
Taiwan
will
have
a
shortfall
of
close
to
2,100
megawatts
,
construction
of
the
Fourth
Nuclear
Power
Plant
should
continue
,
but
no
further
nuclear
plants
would
be
built
,
and
the
first
,
second
and
third
plants
would
be
decommissioned
on
reaching
the
end
of
their
normal
operating
lives
.

Yeh

Peng
commented
:
"
During
her
first
term
as
a
legislator
she
acted
a
lot
like
a
substitute
,
so
every
time
she
questioned
officials
or
addressed
a
session
she
would
say
that
such
and
such
was
communicated
to
her
in
a
dream
by
Cheng
Nan
-
jung
.

These
are
the
biggest
issues
faced
by
the
new
cabinet
.

I
also
took
the
opportunity
to
personally
get
an
understanding
of
how
<ENAMEX
TYPE="EVENT">the
DPI
/
NGO
Conference</ENAMEX>
works
,
and
of
the
direction
of
mainstream
international
thinking
,
and
I
collected
a
lot
of
relevant
information
in
the
form
of
conference
materials
.

In
the
past
,
NGOs
merely
played
a
monitoring
role
at
the
UN
,
but
now
the
trend
is
towards
their
involvement
in
policy
implementation
.

From
filming
"
Aboriginal
News
Magazine
"
and
"
Our
Island
"
for
Public
Television
Service
and
"
Declaration
of
Life
"
for
Super
TV
,
to
becoming
the
independent
director
he
is
today
,
Mayaw
has
always
insisted
on
following
his
own
ideas
.

What
makes
it
special
among
the
309
urban
and
rural
townships
of
Taiwan
?

Even
before
the
arrival
of
Westerners
in
Taiwan
,
Han
Chinese
often
crossed
over
from
China
to
Tanshui
,
which
is
relatively
close
to
the
mainland
.

This
little
town
has
everything
from
nursery
schools
to
graduate
schools
.

Though
the
founders
of
many
of
these
shops
have
passed
away
,
the
second
generation
has
taken
the
baton
.

Tu
says
,
with
disbelief
and
exasperation
in
his
voice
:
"
Do
you
know
that
they
are
going
to
build
a
huge
bridge
between
Tanshui
and
Pali
?

Tanshui
Township

also
spelled
Tamsui

is
part

There
will
now
be
a
legal
basis
for
the
high
-
speed
railway
to
raise
more
capital
.

However
,
the
Executive
Yuan
argues
that
Taiwan
's
coastal
policing
work
also

'm
constantly
thinking

"
We
make

Together
they
formed

Fan
Group
,
and
eventually
they
became
known
as
the
"
Eight
Great
Outlaws
"
of
Taiwanese
modern
art
.

From
paintings
of
his
done
during
that
early
period
,
one
sees
how
Hsia
rendered
human
figures
using
the
thick
lines
of
traditional
Chinese
folk
painting
,
but
proceeded
to
dissect
and
reassemble
those
figures
in
a
Western
,
mechanistic
fashion
.

"
This
was
something
I
really
knew
I

Hsia

becoming
sculptures

A

struck

Lu

says
with
exasperation
:
"
This
was
not
an
unreasonable
request
.

In
fact
,
this
is
the
fourth
time
that
Cheng
has
done
reproductions
of
prehistoric
pottery
.

In
an
effort
to
capture
the
ambivalent
facial
expression
,
he
imagined
the
jar
as
a
bust
-
length
portrait
of
a
woman
.

They
could
take
the
kneaded
clay
,
wrap
it
on
the
outside
of
the
shards
,
and
tap
it
down
lightly
with
a
wooden
stick
to
make
the
clay
more
compact
and
solid
.

In
virtually
all
archeological
reports
,
prehistoric
pottery
includes
gravel
,
usually
at
a
level
of
25
-
30
%

"
This
could
encourage
interaction
and
partnership
,
and
even
in
a
small
way
create
a
sense
of
having
returned
to
the
tribal
village
.
"

Cheng
Yung
-
gwo
's
dream
is
to
sit
at
home
around
a
fire
with
a
few
friends
,
firing
pots
and
drinking
wine
.

Information
and
analyses
are
forwarded
to
the
president
for
his
reference
,
said
Chien
,
but
no
one
focuses
on
particular
individuals
or
political
parties
.

Investigators
complain
that
they
do
n't
know
who
to
listen
to
,
and
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
concentrate
on
their
work
and
play
their
proper
role
in
the
justice
system
.

Chen
took
his
first
act
as
president
by
signing
his
name
to
the
appointments
of
Tang
Fei
as
premier
,
Chang
Chun
-
hsiung
as

general
of
the
Office
of
the

,
and
Chuang
Ming
-
yao
as
secretary

general
of
the
National

Council
.

US
President
Bill

praised
Chen
's
speech
as
pragmatic
and
constructive
,
and
stated
his
hope
that
the
two
sides
would
be
able
to
resume
dialogue
at
an
early
date

Whether
Taiwanese
readers
were
just
putting
on
airs
or
actually
enjoyed
the
book
,
if
the
Gao
frenzy
reinvigorates
Taiwanese
interest
in
pure
literature
,
it
will
have
done
a
world
of
good
.

This
standoff
between
the
Nobel
laureate
and
his
cultural
motherland
adds
a
note
of
regret
to
the
joy
of
Chinese
people
around
the
world
.

Nobel
laureate
Gao

and
long
-
time
advocate
of
his

were
the
stars
of
this

's
Taipei
International
Book
Exhibition
.

This
is
the
elderly
's
perspective
on
the
universe
,
and
it
gives
them
very
different
ideas
about
meaning
and
beauty
.

In
fact
,
it
is
a
return
to
the
main
thread
of
his
concerns
of
30
years
ago
.

In
the
past
,
Huang
's
"
generation
gap
"
separated
him
from
the
people
he
was
writing
about
-
people
of
his
grandparents
'
generation
,
two
generations
removed
from
his
own
.

When
Huang
writes
of
sad
events
,
his
readers
'
eyes
really
do
fill
with
tears

says
that
there
is
a
limit
to
how
many
people
are
reached
by

"
The
interesting
thing
about

that

On
another
front
,
in
terms
of
tourism
,
in
June
of
2001
Taiwan
expects
to
implement
a
new
policy
allowing
mainland
tourists
to
come
to
Taiwan
.

The
crisis
sparked
by
PRC
missile
tests
pushed
the
security
of
Taiwan
to
the
top
of
the
issue
list
,
and
the
ticket
of
Lee
Teng
-
hui
and
Lien
Chan
of
the
ruling
Kuomintang
,
which
promised
stability
,
won
the
election
with
54
%
of
the
vote
.

A
terrifying
topic
?

No
one
has
the
ability
to
alter
this
consensus
.

Kuo
Shu
-
min
of
the
China
Times
Express
,
a
longtime
observer
of
the
KMT
,
says
that
controversy
over
James
Soong
goes
back
to
the
days
when
the
KMT
ruled
over
Taiwan
and
repressed
all
opposition
.

Lee
Teng
-
hui
is
similar
to
Bill
Clinton
,
who
has
a
personal
charisma
that
moves
people
.

Compared
to
Lien
Chan
,
who
comes
from
a
wealthy
family
,
Chen
Shui
-
bian
,
who
is
an
entirely
self
-
made
man
,
makes
a
marked
contrast
.

Soong
has
taken
into
account
the
long
-
existing
disparity
between
state
-
funded
and
private
secondary
schools
in
Taiwan
-LRB-
private
schools
are
much
more
expensive
,
though
they
merely
provide
the
same
education
as
the
state
schools
-RRB-
.

This
applies
to
economic
relations
with
the
PRC
as
well
.

Governing
is
different

But
he
carries
a
heavy
burden
.

If
education
is
done
well
,
the
benefits
will
spread
to
many
other
areas
.

"
Middle
age
is
the
afternoon
,
but
I
ca
n't
say
I
have
much
time
to
drink
tea
!
"

But
in
trying
to
show
he
was
not
out
of
touch
with
youth
,
Mr.
Chou
,
the
45
-
year
-
old
boss
of
a
computer
components
company
,
had
an
experience
which
left
him
not
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
.

Alice
Lu
,
director
of
the
International
Family
Life
Education
Center
,
suggests
that
"
change
"
would
be
a
better
term
than
"
crisis
"
for
the
mood
swings
and
difficulties
of
middle
age
.

With
more
and
more
people
remaining
single
,
rising
divorce
rates
,
growing
numbers
of
unmarried
mothers
,
increasing
occurrence
of
infertility
,
and
the
emergence
of
large
numbers
of
families
where
husband
and
wife
live
in
different
cities
,
or
even
-
as
for
many
expatriate
Taiwanese
business
people
-
in
different
countries
,
many
middle
-
aged
people
's
carefully
laid
life
plans
have
suddenly
come
to
nothing
.

But
she
realized
that
under
the
dual
pressure
of
her
need
for
career
success
and
her
unfulfilled
emotional
needs
,
she
was
approaching
a
state
of
psychological
collapse
.

At
present
,
Ms.
Chiang
has
a
boyfriend
ten
years
her
junior
.

"
Whenever
I
notice
I
'm
getting
down
,
I
start
looking
for
things
to
do
,
"
she
says
.

Chao
continues
with
the
same
forthright
,
sincere
smile
:

Who
will
tell
me
?
!

Two
years
ago
,
encouraged
by
his
wife
,
who
works
for
an
estate
agency
,
Lin
went
on
a
pre-work
training
course
at
the
agency
.

Looking
back
on
this
phase
of
her
life
,
Chiu
can
not
suppress
a
smile
.

Every
one
could
tell
a
story
of
life
's
reversals
.

In
Taiwan
,
in
recent
years
the
Ministry
of
Economic
Affairs
,
the
National
Science
Council
and
the
National
Health
Research
Institutes
have
been
strongly
pursuing
"
biochip
"
research
programs
.

BMEC
general
director
Dr.
Johnsee
Lee
says
that
the
ITRI
's
four
-
year
R-AMP-D
program
in
biochip
applications
and
technology
is
now
in
its
second
year
.

However
,
Pan
points
out
that
because
of
the
difficulties
in
substantially
reducing
the
time
needed
for
sample
preparation
,
the
usefulness
of
such
a
fever
chip
is
still
limited
,
so
that
it
can
not
yet
be
widely
promoted
.

Kuo
states
that
at
present
,
the
number
of
known
target
sequences
for
disease
-
treating
drugs
is
only
around
500
,
but
as
the
human
genome
is
mapped
out
this
number
can
be
expected
to
increase
tenfold
.

In
other
words
,
whereas
in
the
past
researchers
had
to
investigate
each
gene
individually
,
today
,
using
biochips
,
they
can
obtain
test
results
for
tens
of
thousands
of
genes
at
once
.

But
one
day
they
will
play
an
important
role
in
all
our
lives
.

Then
the
young
boy
playing
the
prince
replies
"
You
are
beautiful
!
"

Just
how
widespread
is
this
English
learning
among
our
primary
students
?

English
language
teaching
in
primary
schools
is
a
key
plank
in
a
range
of
curriculum
reforms
to
take
us
into
the
new
century
.

English
lessons
for
children
emphasize
situations
,
fun
,
and
practice
.

"
He
just
could
n't
understand
a
thing
his
teacher
was
saying
,
and
he
asked
if
he
could
go
to
a
private
English
school
.
"

This
way
,
they
'll
feel
that
the
teacher
is
giving
them
some
attention
,
and
that
their
needs
are
also
being
catered
for
.

The
Ministry
of
Education
has
already
drawn
up
a
whole
range
of
plans
for
teacher
training
.

It
's
something
new
and
it
's
still
finding
its
place
in
the
curriculum
,
"
says
Chen
Chien
-
hao
,
from
Jen
Ai
Primary
School
.

For
people
living
in
cosmopolitan
Taipei
,
there
are
lots
of
opportunities
to
speak
English
.

The
people
of
Palau
are
of
the
same
ethnic
background
as
the
aboriginal
people
of
Taiwan
-
Malayo
-
Polynesian
.

Zero
pollution

These
islands
have
great
potential
as
sites
for
historical
tourism
.

Hsu
concludes
:
"
If
the
price
is
raised
for
tour
groups
,
no
one
is
interested
,
but
if
the
original
price
is
maintained
,
the
tour
operators
'
profit
falls
too
low
.

It
offers
advanced
freezing
facilities
and
two
aircraft
,
guaranteeing
to
deliver
tuna
fresh
to
the
Japanese
market
within
24
hours
.

He
says
that
right
now
the
main
obstacles
to
foreign
investment
are
land
acquisition
and
communications
.

It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
Lee
's
visit
will
bring
any
change
in
sensitive
cross-strait
relations
,
but
President
Chen
Shui
-
bian
revealed
after
Lee
's
departure
that
he
and
his
guest
had
reached
three
points
of
consensus
,
including
the
need
for
a
Singapore
-
Taiwan
free
-
trade
zone
.

Foreign
Minister
Tien
Hung
-
mao
was
quoted
as
saying
,
"
I
feel
a
bit
kicked
around
.
"

In
recent
years
the
museum
,
primarily
known
for
its
collection
of
treasures
from
the
palaces
of
Ming
and
Qing
dynasty
China
,
has
broadened
its
remit
and
begun
acquiring
newly
excavated
artifacts
as
well
as
20th
century
calligraphy
and
painting
-
including
works
by
such
luminaries
as
Chang
Ta
-
chien
,
Qi
Baishi
,
Yu
Yo
-
jen
and
Tai
Ching
-
nung
.

However
,
perhaps
due
to
his
familiarity
with
what
was
best
in
Chinese
art
,
Wang
did
n't
take
this
interest
in
Western
art
any
further
.

Having
settled
on
a
layout
,
he
would
then
carve
the
seal
in
one
go
,
using
the
knife
with
fluid
ease
.

However
,
Wang
himself
was
alert
to
the
risk
of
his
calligraphy
becoming
over-refined
,
and
he
began
incorporating
the
robustness
of
the
beibei
style
into
his
brushwork
,
aiming
for
a
style
that
was
more
"
raw
and
intense
.
"

This
love
of
reading
did
n't
wane
at
all
in
his
later
years
,
and
when
he
found
his
memory
failing
he
carved
himself
a
seal
with
the
exhortatory
motto
:
"
The
more
you
forget
the
more
you
need
to
read
.
"

After
a
lifetime
dedicated
to
the
pursuit
of
art
,
Wang
at
last
entered
that
state
of
freedom
in
which
"
the
man
and
his
calligraphy
have
both
attained
maturity
.
"

"
Image
of
a
mind
become
steadily
more
abstinent
,
"
and
"
Ink
and
happiness
.
"

Now
when
you
look
at
advertising
billboards
or
magazines
,
you
see
men
displaying
their
oiled
-
up
muscles
,
shiny
white
teeth
,
smooth
and
clean
-
shaven
skin
,
and
elegant
attire
.

Men
are
giving
away
nothing
to
their
sisters
in
the
search
for
beautiful
bodies
,
as
is
suggested
by
a
few
recent
disputes
between
male
beauty
salons
and
dissatisfied
customers
.

Men
also
are
increasingly
feeling
pushed
by
women
in
the
realm
of
cosmetic
surgery
and
body
shaping
.

Wang
Hao
-
wei
,
a
psychiatrist
who
frequently
writes
on
the
subject
of
men
in
Taiwan
,
says
that
guys
by
nature
find
it
hard
to
reveal
their
softer
sides
.

Ideally
,
businesses
and
popular
culture
want
to
be
able
to
sweep
everyone
up
in
a
single
net
,
and
would
prefer
not
to
break
their
market
up
by
gender
.

This
is
especially
apparent
in
the
entertainment
community
,
which
sets
the
pace
for
popular
culture
and
is
often
the
fastest
to
pick
up
on
new
trends
.

Right
now
shape
is
what
's
in
.

But
,
counters
Chen
Tsai
-
ching
,
director
of
guidance
counseling
at
the
Lungshan
Middle
School
,
it
is
in
the
nature
of
young
people
in
whatever
era
to
worry
about
their
looks
.

There
is
more
at
work
here
,
however
,
than
just
looking
good
,
and
many
men
now
feel
,
as
many
women
have
long
felt
,
that
dressing
up
is
forced
on
them
by
society
.

Lin
Ching
-
yun
,
who
often
helps
politicians
with
their
images
,
says
frankly
that
many
politicos
come
to
have
their
wrinkles
and
the
bags
under
their
eyes
removed
before
they
go
for
photo
sessions
.

Despite
such
anecdotal
evidence
,
however
,
there
are
hopes
that
there
will
be
positives
from
the
new
male
fashion
sense
.

The
wax
apple
is
a
tropical
fruit
originating
from
the
Malay
peninsula
.

The
revamping
of
Linpien
started
eight
or
nine
years
ago
,
when
schoolteacher
Tsao
Chi
-
hung
-
now
a
DPP
deputy
in
the
national
legislature
-
along
with
fellow
members
of
the
Linpien
Residents
'
Democracy
Association
launched
a
program
to
sweep
the
streets
and
keep
the
riverbank
clean
.

We
also
hope
to
foster
the
commercial
interests
of
the
community
so
as
to
bring
practical
benefits
for
people
's
lives
.

Development
of
the
long
-
promised
Tapeng
Bay
Scenic
Area
is
due
to
begin
,
and
in
2003
the
2nd
Southern
Freeway
will
open
.

Using
special
growing
techniques
,
the
farmers
of
Linpien
control
the
quantity
of
blossoms
on
the
trees
so
as
to
optimize
the
production
of
their
treasured
black

apples
.

Starting

The
Internet
lifestyle

Will
the
Election
Weaken
Political
Parties
?

This
is
the
beginning
of
the
post-strongman
era
.

They
were
president
because
they
were
powerful
,
not
powerful
because
they
were
president
.

The
DPP
sees
this
election
as
its
chance
to
displace
the
KMT
and
set
a
precedent
for
the
peaceful
rotation
of
political
parties
in
power
,
thereby
consolidating
its
position
as
the
main
alternative
to
the
KMT
.

The
Chen
camp
is
well
aware
of
this
problem
.

In
the
past
,
state
policy
has
always
been
decided
by
the
party
chairman
.

It
will
be
virtually
impossible
for
the
KMT
to
railroad
through
legislation
under
the
leadership
of
a
president
who
does
n't
enjoy
majority
public
support
.
"

Though
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
such
a
situation
would
be
stable
,
for
those
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
current
choices
and
who
want
a
reshuffling
of
party
politics
in
Taiwan
,
this
is
the
opportunity
to
create
a
fresh
climate
.

This
has
long
been
a
tactic
used
in
Taiwan
elections
.

Visiting
superstores
-
with
their
ample
parking
,
restaurants
and
piles
of
consumer
goods
-
has
become
a
major
leisure
-
time
activity
.

A
hundred
-
some
foreign
stores
do
NT$
110
billion
in
business
a
year
.

Mr.
Wu
has
just
completed
his
step
aerobics
class
.

Others
,
like
California
Fitness
Centers
and
Gold
's
Gym
,
set
up
in
commercial
districts
,
aiming
for
office
workers
.

A
mix
of
freebies
and
challenges
is
better
at
keeping
consumers
'
motivation
high
.

But
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
differences
in
definitions
of
beauty
have
affected
exercise
preferences
.

Chung

says
that
from

to

whole
families
take
up
special
offers
and
join
together
,
but
,
in
her
opinion
,
health

One
example
is

,
a
combination
of
Chinese
sausage
,
cabbage
and
tripe
-
not
precisely
Portuguese

nor

A

will
only
enrich

not

What
sunset
industry
?

These
were
the
peak
of
the
large
investments
made
in
Taiwan
's
textile
industry
over
recent
years
.

But
Taiwan
had
no
manufacturing
capability
in
the
fiber
,
and
relied
entirely
on
imports
.

Behind
the
quest
for
innovation
and
change
,
there
needs
to
be
a
great
deal
of
R-AMP-D
work
,
along
with
a
keen
nose
for
the
market
.

G
-
Fun
's
micropore
breathable
coating
is
a
compound
containing
special
water
-
soluble
granules
which
create
tiny
pores
in
the
fabric
surface
.

With
Taiwan
's
long
years
of
manufacturing
experience
,
it
is
then
not
difficult
to
reproduce
the
product
with
70
-
80
%
accuracy
.

Finally
he
used
a
three
-
dimensional
model
to
create
a
regularly
graded
,
finely
differentiated
color
reference
system
covering
20,000
colors
,
each
with
clear
"
color
coordinates
.
"

Among
them
is
King

Company
,
the
only
firm
in
Taiwan
which
draws
fibers
from
stainless
steel
.

An
unusual
fashion
show
at
the
China
Textile
Institute
's
40th
anniversary
celebration
:
the
focus
is
not
on
showing
fashionable
new
styles
,
but
on
introducing
the
latest
fruits
of
textile
product
development
in
the
ROC
.

Various
kinds
of
protective
fabrics
find
a
wide
range
of
applications
in
industry
.

Optoelectronics
is
seemingly
the
exclusive
province
of
the
new
"
technobility
,
"
in
which
case
Yeh
Chin
-
tai
,
a
plastics
entrepreneur
and
manufacturer
of
phonograph
records
,
breaks
the
mold
.

Later
Yeh
established
the
Platinum
Music
recording
studio
and
went
abroad
to
keep
up
on
the
latest
industry
trends
.

Their
replacements
,
CDs
and
VCDs
,
are
now
cresting
,
soon
to
be
vanquished
by
DVDs
,
which
though
next
in
line
are
already
feeling
mini-disks
closing
in
on
them
.

Now
everything
from
ordering
and
production
to
storage
and
shipping
is
computerized
.

But
they
ca
n't
keep
up
with
demand
,
so
Yeh
has
gone
to
the
mainland
to
establish
more
factories
,
where
he
has
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
vast
mainland
market
.

As
diligent
as
ever
,
he
still
scurries
back
and
forth
between
Taipei
and
the
Hukou
area
of
Hsinchu
on
a
daily
basis
.

Does
Taiwan
meet
these
criteria
?

Its
product
fits
onto
a
tiny
microchip
.

And
if
there
is
a
problem
,
it
can
be
identified
immediately
,
avoiding
guesswork
and
wasted
time
.

Simon
Chang
,
who
left
the
job
of
director
of
planning
at
the
National
Science
Council
only
six
months
ago
to
enter
the
private
sector
,
points
out
that
the
knowledge
-
based
economy
basically
deals
in
information
technology
,
and
the
IT
industry
is
the
most
profitable
region
in
the
emerging
geography
of
the
knowledge
-
based
economy
.

Tan
notes
that
although
DRAM
factories
are
closing
one
after
another
in
the
US
,
patent
royalties
must
still
be
paid
to
Texas
Instruments
for
each
and
every
one
of
the
more
than
100
million
DRAMs
produced
around
the
world
annually
.

But
,
because
of
different
machine
designs
,
the
gap
can
be
80
,
90
,
or
100
stitches
,
creating
problems
for
quality
control
.

In
these
ways
,
VIA
is
moving
step
by
step
to
enlarge
its
intellectual
holdings
.

But
when
Comdek
's
product
came
out
,
Michael
Kuo
still
found
himself
in
a
vicious
struggle
with
Taiwan
pirate
firms
:
"
It
's
equivalent
to
making
fools
out
of
those
of
us
who
invest
the
money
to
do
research
and
development
!
"

They
do
n't
know
how
to
spread
knowledge
so
that
others
will
make
money
for
them
!

Separately
,
during
his
report
to
the
Legislative
Yuan
on
the
Academia
Sinica
's

,
Lee
reiterated
:
"
If
the
whole
population
could
arrive
at
a
consensus
on
'
one
China
,
'
then
President
Chen
would
have
no
grounds
for
not
accepting
that
consensus
.
"

The
Presidential
Advisory
Group
met
again
on
November
26
,
and
discussed
a
proposal
,
made
earlier
by
Public
Television
System
chairman
Wu
Feng
-
shan
and
already
favored
by
most
members
of
the
Group
,
for
"
one
China
"
to
be
addressed
through
"
three
acknowledgements
and
four
suggestions
.

exactly

Although
the
Southeast
Asians
have
n't
had
quite
the
impact
of
the
returning
overseas
Chinese
from
North
America
,
they
have
staked
out
their
piece
of
the
pop
music
field
.

For
the
most
part
,
they
have
"
clean

fresh
"
images
and
either
sing
folk
songs
or
adopt
a
modern
version
of
the
traditional
Japanese
enka

style

A
few
years
ago
,
when
New

was
newly
opened
up
to
immigration
and
there
were
n't
many
Chinese
around
,
hardly
anyone
had
heard
of
the
Hua

,
and
inviting

to

was
always
fraught

For
instance
,
when
you
see
that
a
hair
has
fallen
onto
a
female
friend
's
shoulder
,
you
should
lightly
pick
it
off
for
her
,
and
throw
it
away
or
put
it
in
your
pocket
.

it
's
true
that
good
looks
can
come
from
external
grooming
,
wearing
nice
clothes
,
or
wearing
earrings
;
and
perhaps
you
can
get
other
people
's
attention
by
creating
your
own
special
look
.

This
team
,
which
had
received
three
months
of
training
in
the
US
last
year
,
went
immediately
into
action
after
their
long
air
trip
,
as
the
search
and
rescue
command
center
in
El
Salvador
arranged
for
it
to
head
to
Las
Colinas
,
where
the
worst
of
the
disaster
had
taken
place
.

While
relief
teams
have
been
dispatched
from
around
the
world
,
India
indicated
that
it
would
not
need
assistance
from
Taiwan
for
the
time
being
.

Microsoft

Bill

did

1.
No
matter
how
complex
your
company
,
it
must
have
a
basic
conception
that
is
clear
and
easy
to
understand
.

The
Japanese
management
guru
Matsushita
Konosuke

3.
Your
past
failure
is
your
MBA
from
the
school
of
hard
knocks
.

Therefore
,
you
have
to
consider
the
following
:

This
is
a
result
of
the
problem
,
not
its
cause
!

To
answer
this
question
,
you
've
got
to
focus
on
your
"
market
segment
.
"

The
latter
determines
whether
there
will
be
detrimental
competition
.

Question
#
12
:
When
will
you
break
even
?

1.
Pay
attention
to
cash
and
cash
flow
.

Then
refrigerators
replaced
ice
factories
.

Rather
,
the
National
Assembly
will
become
a
"
task
-
based
body
"
generated
according
to
proportional
political
party
representation
in
the
legislature
,
maintaining
the
rights
to
ratification
of
constitutional
revisions
proposed
by
the
Legislative
Yuan
,
impeachment
of
the
president
and
vice
president
,
and
resolutions
on
modifications
to
national
territory
.

In
the
face
of
a
parliament
with
supreme
powers
,
a
president
whose
party
claims
only
a
minority
in
the
legislature
is
powerless
even
to
replace
a
premier
with
whom
he
does
not
see
eye
to
eye
,
leaving
him
devoid
of
the
authorities
and
responsibilities
to
correspond
with
his
administrative
actions
.

The
ocean
waves
brought
the
oil
to
shore
,
making
a
mess
of
the
beautiful
coral
coastline
,
slathering
shellfish
and
aquatic
plants
,
and
filling
the
air
with
a
petroleum
stench
.

The
lack
of
a
detailed
understanding
of
the
Lungkeng
ecology
presents
a
perfect
case
in
point
.

We
are
not
part
of
this
subject
ah
and
we
are
not
part
of
this
speech
he
will
give
.

Mr.
Fayyad
,
I
mean
,
after
Amr
Moussa
's
talks
today
,
can
we
say
there
is
any
progress
in
the
air
?

I
mean
,
I
think
it
's
not
Oman
.

Yes
,
I
mean
,
can
we
say
that
the
insistence
,
that
the
insistence
,
of
the
governing
team
not
to
step
down
,
the
reason
for
it
is
not
the
strength
of
its
position
,
but
the
outside
support
for
it
?

The
government
receives
encouragement
from
the
Legislative
Council
,
thus
it
becomes
effective
as
if
the
appointment
letter
and
the
National
Reconciliation
document
or
the
prisoners
are
worthless
.

The
total
cost
of
the
project
is
240
million
Egyptian
pounds
,
a
grant
from
the
Ministry
of
International
Cooperation
.

Russia
has
not
left
the
region
and
has
not
distanced
itself
from
,
uh
,
the
Lebanese
issue
,
uh
,
it
had
a
clear
role
in
,
uh
,
all
the
discussions
that
went
on
at
the
Security
Council
,
including
,
uh
,
the
%pw
international
resolutions
.

But
they
expressed
it
and
said
there
are
no
magic
solutions
.

Housing
projects
have
to
be
provided
by
the
state
to
the
weak
,
incapable
social
classes
.

The
president
is
the
head
of
the
executive
power
,
and
is
the
sponsor
of
the
three
powers
,
according
to
statute
and
we
're
in
a
real
trouble
,
political
trouble
.

Aha
.

And
some
also
ask
about
those
who
support
these
groups
and
who
support
these
bombings
which
were
able
to
,
I
mean
,
penetrate
all
the
,
the
security
barriers
that
surround
Baghdad
.

But
she
did
not
refer
to
the
other
side
,
the
victims
among
the
innocent
children
,
that
is
a
crime
against
all
laws
and
divine
--
as
well
as
earthly
--
norms
.

Okay
.

Control
over
parliament
would
be
decided
in
the
second
round
of
the
elections
,
which
takes
place
next
month
in
thirty
-
three
electoral
districts
,
and
sixty
-
six
lists
compete
in
it
,
including
thirty
-
four
independent
and
thirty
-
two
for
the
political
parties
.

No
,
naturally
,
the
Supreme
Council
has
its
own
policy
,
and
I
believe
it
is
a
party
that
has
its
political
plan
.

Now
they
have
begun
to
feel
guilty
in
their
conscience
and
accountable
because
they
harmed
their
nation
,
they
harmed
their
families
,
they
harmed
their
country
.

That
is
,
the
opposition
so
far
is
saying
that
the
street
is
the
main
path
to
,
yeah
,
yeah
,
changing
the
government
.

I
think
%pw
that
most
of
Bolton
's
efforts
were
aimed
at
the
hawkish
view
towards
Iran
.

I
do
n't
know
what
form
Speaker
Berri
's
possible
initiative
might
take
;
however
,
under
the
weight
of
these
two
demands
,
it
is
impossible
for
Speaker
Berri
to
make
any
new
moves
.

It
did
n't
happen
.

What
is
your
comment
?

Ah
an
occasion
ah
I
mean
,
during
which
we
think
of
the
great
achievements
of
this
nation
,
we
think
of
ah
how
we
became
ah
of
the
pioneer
Arab
countries
that
are
pointed
to
ah
with
the
fingers
after
we
started
--
we
started
I
mean
ah
hard
beginnings
.

Yes
,
the
ruling
relied
on
Article
53
of
the
Libyan
Penal
Code
,
which
pertains
to
spreading
diseases
.

I
mean
,
to
begin
with
,
uh
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
what
happened
yesterday
was
a
historic
referendum
in
the
history
of
Lebanon
,
since
its
establishment
and
until
this
moment
.

Fahd
,
you
are
in
Mogadishu
;
what
's
the
latest
information
you
have
received
so
far
?

But
what
Israel
did
not
fail
to
observe
was
that
the
societal
war
,
if
it
were
able
to
wage
it
and
destroy
Arab
society
from
the
inside
,
then
it
would
have
the
final
victory
.

This
Authority
was
built
on
the
basis
of
agreements
that
have
not
been
implemented
.

Aha
,
aha
.

The
construction
of
Hong
Kong
Disneyland
began
two
years
ago
,
in
2003
.

Although
Disney
Corporation
chose
Hong
Kong
as
the
venue
for
the
Chinese
Disney
park
,
what
they
are
actually
most
excited
about
is
the
mainland
China
tourist
market
.

However
,
since
Disney
entered
Hong
Kong
,
the
Ocean
Park
,
sharing
the
same
city
as
Disney
,
has
felt
the
pressure
of
competition
.

He
is
my
.

Ten
landmark
buildings
located
on
Hong
Kong
Island
reveal
themselves
one
by
one
,
participating
in
the
show
in
full
splendor
,
presenting
a
world
-
class
light
extravaganza
to
a
musical
rhythm
.

Lastly
,
farthest
away
you
can
see
Putian
of
Shenzhen
.

These
have
become
the
best
spots
to
observe
birds
.

Like
what
's
used
in
our
Symphony
of
Lights
.

It
's
extremely
troublesome
to
get
there
via
land
.

Ah
,
they
are
now
rehearsing
.

Recently
,
the
2005
Ningxia
Investment
and
Trade
Fair
and
Ningxia
-
Taiwan
Economic
and
Trade
Cooperation
Seminar
were
held
in
the
city
of
Yinchuan
.

In
1940
,
the
German
army
invaded
and
occupied
Czechoslovakia
,
Poland
,
the
Netherlands
,
Belgium
,
and
France
.

That
was
to
use
railways
as
a
pillar
,
roads
as
a
chain
,
and
strongholds
as
a
lock
,
to
carry
out
siege
warfare
in
an
attempt
to
divide
the
base
areas
behind
enemy
lines
,
ah
,
so
as
,
er
,
to
cut
off
their
communication
with
one
another
.

Villager
Xiao
Jianghe
has
a
vivid
memory
of
this
piece
of
history
.

He
himself
would
bring
these
people
,
this
group
of
people
to
blow
up
that
Wudu
bridge
.
%pw

So
,
there
were
probably
600,000
-
plus
soldiers
and
civilians
.

In
addition
,
many
people
were
poisoned
when
toxic
gas
was
released
.

One
was
responsible
only
for
cutting
electrical
wires
,
and
the
other
for
destroying
roads
.

In
this
way
,
a
blockade
line
of
steel
regarded
as
a
lifeline
by
the
Japanese
army
was
paralyzed
.

I
took
them
out
for
a
look
every
day
.

Just
as
Mao
Zedong
once
praised
:
Who
dares
wield
his
sword
and
make
his
horse
rear
?

The
Hundred
Regiments
Offensive
wrote
a
glorious
page
in
the
history
of
China
's
War
of
Resistance
against
Japan
.

Scholars
will
give
you
a
detailed
analysis
on
this
edition
of
Hot
Topic
Analysis
.

Prior
to
the
APEC
meeting
,
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Junichiro
Koizumi
visited
Yasukuni
Shrine
for
the
fifth
time
and
was
strongly
condemned
by
Asian
nations
such
as
China
and
South
Korea
.

Ah
,
first
of
all
,
I
think
,
ah
,
this
,
this
time
,
ah
,
when
Koizumi
arrived
in
Pusan
,
ah
,
he
had
this
in
his
mind
.

Uh-huh
.

Right
.

So
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
he
might
feel
it
was
even
worse
than
not
meeting
at
all
.

Well
,
looking
at
the
situation
in
Asia
,
actually
,
it
is
exactly
the
other
way
round
.

Uh-huh
.

It
is
impossible
.

He
said
,
er
,
Sino
-
Japanese
relations
,
ah
,
right
now
,
Japan
-
China
relations
are
not
like
,
er
,
what
the
international
community
is
worried
about
.

Well
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
respect
to
Japan
's
investment
in
China
,
during
the
first
half
of
last
year
,
Japan
's
investment
projects
in
China
decreased
by
8.2
%
while
the
contractual
amount
decreased
by
0.4
%
.

Uh-huh
.

Ah
,
in
addition
,
from
his
point
of
view
,
he
is
counting
on
his
luck
to
a
large
extent
.

As
a
result
,
this
small
island
just
a
bit
over
90
kilometers
from
Utsuryo
Island
,
South
Korea
,
again
triggered
a
diplomatic
conflict
between
the
two
countries
.

Uh-huh
.

Er
,
he
himself
thought
,
er
,
that
he
was
probably
100
%
,
200
%
,
er
,
200
%
correct
in
what
he
has
been
doing
.

Uh-huh
.

He
appointed
them
as
,
right
,
appointed
them
as
defense
minister
or
foreign
minister
.

In
fact
it
is
not
merely
an
issue
of
Sino
-
Japanese
relations
or
Japanese
-
Korean
relations
.

However
,
based
on
the
selection
and
formation
of
his
,
er
,
cabinet
,
it
seems
that
Koizumi
is
making
his
post-resignation
arrangements
,
ah
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

In
reality
it
is
not
necessary
so
.

I
think
this
can
only
prove
Koizumi
's
stubbornness
.

Thank
you
too
,
dear
viewers
,
for
watching
!

Shanghai
,
overcast
changing
to
light
rain
,
11
to
15
degrees
.

It
can
be
said
that
the
four
northern
islands
issue
is
always
an
obstacle
that
Putin
can
not
sidestep
while
visiting
Japan
.

Uh-huh
.

Host
.

It
only
provided
Koizumi
with
a
diplomatic
stage
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

Well
,
by
making
investments
there
,
in
fact
,
well
,
it
would
be
equivalent
to
permanent
recognition
that
the
four
islands
are
Russia
's
.

Russia
now
,
it
has
independently
formulated
a
strategic
vision
of
developing
the
Far
East
and
Siberian
regions
.

Accordingly
,
the
date
of
Putin
's
visit
to
Japan
turned
into
a
variable
which
nobody
could
explain
.

There
was
nothing
like
this
in
the
past
.

Well
,
as
Russia
should
be
said
to
badly
need
Japanese
funds
,
as
well
as
badly
needing
Japanese
economic
cooperation
,
well
,
how
urgent
do
you
think
Russia
's
need
is
?

That
is
to
say
,
at
that
time
if
Japan
had
made
a
very
good
investment
in
Russia
,
well
,
Japan
,
in
terms
of
Russia
's
economy
,
it
could
have
helped
Russia
's
economic
recovery
.

This
year
,
%pw
,
Koizumi
said
it
may
exceed
100
trillion
.

Well
,
as
we
said
,
this
kind
of
nationalist
sentiment
plays
a
great
role
here
.

Uh-huh
.

Therefore
,
there
is
truth
on
both
sides
.

To
ask
the
Soviet
Union
to
declare
war
against
Japan
,
the
US
and
Britain
gave
Russia
the
Chishima
Islands
and
the
southern
part
of
Sakhalin
Island
,
which
Japan
occupied
at
the
time
.

Uh-huh
.

Well
,
if
he
wants
development
in
Asia
,
wo
n't
he
close
the
door
if
he
loses
hold
of
the
four
northern
islands
now
?

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

That
is
to
say
,
eventually
Russia
's
oil
pipeline
will
be
connected
to
a
Pacific
Ocean
port
,
which
will
benefit
Japan
.

A
British
newspaper
revealed
that
the
US
had
planned
to
bomb
the
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
in
Qatar
.

Well
,
at
the
start
of
today
's
program
,
let
's
learn
about
the
full
context
of
this
incident
together
.

Well
,
regarding
this
topic
,
the
first
question
today
is
that
we
want
to
find
out
clearly
whether
this
incident
was
real
or
not
.

Right
.

It
did
not
confirm
anything
.

Right
.

At
that
time
Blair
tried
his
best
to
persuade
him
not
to
do
it
.

Uh-huh
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
when
we
watch
TV
,
we
can
see
many
news
services
,
ah
,
including
the
US
CNN
and
the
British
BBC
,
often
replaying
footage
by
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
.

In
addition
,
you
were
said
to
have
attended
the
inaugural
broadcast
ceremony
.

So
,
what
it
reported
was
in
a
completely
different
style
from
that
of
some
other
Arab
TV
stations
.

Uh-huh
.

We
should
say
this
is
a
very
huge
financial
expenditure
.

That
is
,
the
reason
why
it
can
establish
itself
is
that
it
first
relied
on
the
Afghan
war
,
and
then
the
Iraq
war
after
<ENAMEX
TYPE="EVENT">the
9
/
11</ENAMEX>
.

Uh-huh
.

We
could
say
it
owed
its
success
to
good
opportunities
,
which
it
seized
;

If
you
see
the
war
on
the
US
TV
as
an
electronic
game
and
grand
display
of
smoke
and
fire
,
then
from
the
footage
by
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
,
you
see
the
war
only
as
hell
.

Another
Arabic
nationality
.

I
think
the
reason
,
er
,
is
--
In
the
Middle
East
region
,
in
particular
,
currently
,
many
,
some
US
officials
,
for
instance
,
many
Democrat
officials
,
they
admitted
that
the
US
policies
on
Iraq
and
the
Middle
East
region
,
eh
,
region
have
many
mistakes
.

We
simply
showed
people
the
footage
about
Fallujah
.

Right
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

However
,
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
that
is
,
this
Friday
,
a
stronger
cold
current
will
enter
Xinjiang
in
our
country
.

Paris
,
cloudy
,
1
degree
below
zero
to
4
degrees
.

After
the
holiday
,
what
will
be
done
to
handle
citizens
'
peak
commute
?

The
station
called
me
at
noon
and
said
something
happened
at
Jingguang
Bridge
and
that
I
had
to
go
to
the
station
immediately
to
research
the
upcoming
program
.

Of
course
,
in
private
life
,
people
have
used
SMS
countless
times
to
spread
news
.

Uh-huh
.

Yes
.

In
addition
,
various
media
announcements
were
also
quite
prompt
.

Previously
we
had
a
statistic
,
especially
for
the
ring
roads
in
Beijing
.

Actually
,
in
this
aspect
,
I
think
that
citizens
were
really
quite
cooperative
.

As
buses
that
cross
the
Third
Ring
Road
are
currently
,
right
now
affected
by
the
Jingguang
Bridge
accident
,
ah
,
the
latest
results
this
morning
show
that
32
bus
routes
throughout
the
neighborhood
have
had
to
be
rerouted
.

It
can
be
said
that
measures
were
very
promptly
taken
.

That
is
,
they
think
that
the
government
has
tried
its
best
.

Yes
.

Uh-huh
.

Uh-huh
.

It
is
because
,
we
,
Beijing
Traffic
Radio
Station
,
has
become
a
part
of
emergency
planning
in
Beijing
.

Early
warnings
and
forecasts
.

For
instance
,
many
of
the
pipes
involved
in
this
incident
were
basic
infrastructure
,
public
utilities
industries
.

Well
,
finally
,
let
's
turn
our
attention
to
handling
of
the
situation
,
ah
,
during
the
latter
stages
of
the
cave
-
in
accident
in
Beijing
.

Waste
discharged
has
currently
blocked
this
up
.

Hello
.

Taipei
,
cloudy
changing
to
showers
,
13
to
19
degrees
.

Actually
a
shaved
head
is
really
hard
to
manage
,
is
n't
it
?

Ye
Daying
was
born
in
Changchun
in
1958
.

He
changed
from
a
very
well
-
behaved
child
into
a
naughty
child
.

Was
it
because
people
for
example
would
say
that
your
father
was
such
and
such
,
or
your
family
was
such
and
such
.

Mm
.

I
remember
one
time
the
--
Mm
,
also
,
when
I
was
in
fifth
or
sixth
grade
,
someone
yelled
out
,
Down
with
Ye
Zhengming
,
he
was
yelling
at
me
,
and
I
had
to
fight
them
.

Come
down
,
come
on
,
fight
,
fight
,
fight
.

Wangjiazhuang
,
right
.

said
I
have
to
hack
him
,
have
to
hack
,
so
it
was
more
or
less
like
this
child
.

Mm
.

Right
,
right
,
you
should
,
see
,
like
study
classes
to
educate
good
kids
.

I
think
that
--

That
was
it
,
that
was
it
.

Ha
ha
,
this
--

Mm
.

In
1978
the
big
news
was
that
the
college
entrance
exams
would
be
reinstated
nationwide
,
and
people
of
Ye
Daying
's
age
were
thrilled
.

I
did
n't
take
the
exams
,
I
did
n't
have
the
nerve
,
I
did
n't
try
,
so
--

Although
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
taken
the
exam
,
it
left
Ye
Daying
even
more
convinced
that
movies
were
something
he
could
do
.

Mm
.

So
you
--

It
's
called
Guillain
-
Barre
Syndrome
.

If
you
look
at
when
I
was
in
middle
school
,
based
on
that
bit
of
exercise
--

Our
generation
could
really
find
ourselves
,
I
mean
--

But
why
did
a
peasant
organization
get
involved
in
a
matter
that
should
have
been
resolved
by
the
village
Party
committee
?

At
the
time
,
the
attendance
on
that
day
,
it
was
n't
something
like
that
.

How
many
times
since
the
end
of
'98
have
you
held
similar
training
sessions
?

So
the
150,000
yuan
,
the
head
of
the
credit
union
wanted
to
take
me
to
court
,
he
said
,
I
should
pay
it
back
,
and
I
said
what
I
was
responsible
for
I
would
take
care
of
.

So
after
the
lawyer
arranged
it
all
,
the
head
of
the
credit
union
said
,
finally
we
've
reached
an
agreement
,
and
you
can
pay
it
back
over
six
years
.

I
discovered
that
peasants
are
not
entirely
having
no
money
.

They
said
,
we
hear
that
you
're
raising
capital
illegally
.

Bing
Zheng
,
who
sacrificed
her
own
profits
,
gradually
got
the
peasant
association
working
better
and
better
.

Just
imagine
,
80
%
of
our
village
,
that
is
120
women
joined
in
.

Because
we
all
discussed
things
together
,
very
intensely
.

In
November
2004
,
the
first
business
operated
by
the
peasants
'
association
after
it
was
registered
,
the
Zhaizi
Village
Paint
Plant
,
was
set
up
and
went
into
production
.

There
are
twelve
households
in
the
village
that
were
categorized
as
retarded
or
disabled
and
extremely
poor
households
.

The
peasants
'
association
does
n't
collect
any
membership
dues
;
the
six
technical
service
centers
that
belong
to
it
give
the
members
a
two
-
yuan
discount
on
each
sack
of
fertilizer
.

How
could
he
say
this
?

That
was
the
gist
of
what
Hua
Guofeng
said
.

On
the
eve
of
the
twentieth
anniversary
of
the
Great
Tangshan
Earthquake
,
that
is
in
April
of
1996
,
Qinglong
was
chosen
by
a
United
Nations
agency
to
become
a
successful
model
for
the
integration
of
scientific
research
and
administrative
management
.

What
the
reason
for
that
was
never
became
known
.

We
had
to
take
the
initiative
in
this
.

But
if
we
did
n't
issue
an
earthquake
prediction
and
there
was
a
real
earthquake
,
we
'd
be
embarrassed
in
front
of
the
locals
.

Otherwise
,
it
's
very
difficult
to
ensure
their
life
safety
.

More
than
70
%
of
the
buildings
collapsed
or
were
seriously
damaged
;
the
power
grid
,
the
transport
system
and
mineshaft
elevators
,
ventilation
and
drainage
facilities
were
severely
damaged
.

Uh
,
after
they
had
come
up
,
no
one
at
the
mouth
of
the
mine
had
left
.

It
%pw
,
they
all
had
earthquake
forecast
opinions
,
but
they
did
n't
attract
enough
attention
.

My
appeal
,
one
,
this
one
,
this
one
little
crux
.

But
more
important
is
that
we
,
some
,
I
mean
,
people
who
are
responsible
for
the
earthquake
-
related
decision
-
making
,
they
did
n't
do
their
duty
and
their
responsibility
to
their
utmost
.

Children
are
left
at
home
in
the
rural
areas
,
after
parents
leave
to
work
in
the
city
.

According
to
your
estimation
,
how
many
left
-
behind
children
are
there
in
China
now
?

There
is
no
major
problem
in
the
children
's
material
life
.

When
she
saw
them
,
the
,
the
girl
cried
to
her
and
said
,
"
I
really
do
n't
want
to
stay
here
.

Instead
of
sending
the
child
to
the
hospital
as
quickly
as
possible
,
they
are
influenced
by
some
,
some
habits
in
this
aspect
.

He
felt
particularly
lonely
and
especially
wanted
his
father
to
come
back
.

They
are
forced
into
making
such
decisions
.

More
than
half
of
the
children
in
the
village
are
left
-
behind
children
.

It
was
taken
with
his
father
six
years
ago
,
before
he
sent
him
to
live
with
his
maternal
grandfather
.

What
could
they
talk
about
in
three
minutes
?

Some
children
told
me
,
"
I
secretly
called
my
parents
when
my
custodians
were
not
home
.
"

He
could
look
after
himself
since
he
was
nine
.

However
,
they
all
wanted
their
parents
to
come
back
,
but
half
of
the
children
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
city
.

They
also
have
to
consider
whether
their
children
can
go
to
school
in
the
city
.

He
was
very
good
at
school
.

Will
they
believe
there
is
love
in
society
or
not
?

This
happened
in
the
rural
area
.

This
ha-
went
on
for
about
two
hours
before
they
were
finally
let
out
and
everyone
was
finally
able
to
figure
out
what
had
happened
here
/.

I
know
you
uh
just
got
to
the
scene
/.

Uh
Ethan
how
long
have
you
known
the
alleged
shooter
/?

teen
shooters
they
're
often
descibed
as
you
know
kids
who
have
been
picked
on
or
bullied
by
peers
/.

but
there
is
no
one
definitive
profile
of
this
type
of
criminal
/.

I
I
never
expected
they
could
do
such
a
thing
/.

A
democrat
turned
republican
/.

um
and
th-
they
won
uh
and
in
Virginia
particularly
/.

Still
ahead
on
Three
Sixty
a
family
torn
apart
on
whether
to
let
their
son
die
/.

<ENAMEX
TYPE="MONEY">Three
hundred
forty
million
smackers
/.</ENAMEX>

His
father
decided
that
he
should
be
here
/.

Does
he
make
any
sounds
/?

While
he
says
/-

It
's
scheduled
to
be
released
in
March
/.

And
because
of
that
Rwanda
now
faces
a
problem
/.

Big
elephant
/.

That
's
--
that
's
something
else
/.

We
showed
you
the
huge
elephant
he
encountered
/.

and
of
course
y-
you
're
not
allowed
to
approach
them
/.

they
're
not
a
a
a
King
Kong
type
of
animal
/.

and
you
have
some
video
uh
of
of
what
she
has
done
/.

Because
th-
i-
th-
eh
they
do
n't
want
those
divisions
/.

and
of
course
Rwanda
has
about
three
hundred
and
seventy
,
right
/.

We
're
going
to
have
the
latest
on
this
developing
story
/.

and
you
wo
n't
believe
the
results
/.

Back
to
Jacksboro
Tennessee
now
where
tonight
Campbell
County
Comprehensive
High
School
is
a
crime
scene
the
site
of
today
's
deadly
school
shooting
/.

Do
you
know
anything
more
about
that
/?

Uh
if
we
had
to
pick
a
single
thing
to
underscore
how
completely
life
has
changed
in
this
country
since
nine
eleven
it
might
be
the
fact
that
there
are
now
arguments
serious
ones
not
only
against
but
also
for
torture
/.

and
oh
by
the
way
when
people
are
tortured
,
when
people
endure
physical
pain
they
're
going
to
seek
to
stop
that
as
quickly
as
possible
/.

He
also
says
we
'll
do
whatever
is
necessary
/.

Professor
Yoo
y-
let
me
bring
y-
you
in
here
um
/.

Oh
come
on
/.

D-
I
mean
I
h-
but
is
n't
it
true
that
there
has
always
been
torture
/?

Bill
let
me
uh
r-
uh
r-
tell
you
something
that
Senator
Roberts
has
said
about
the
McCain
amendment
/.

What
's
the
latest
John
/?

we
wo
n't
get
the
results
there
until
tomorrow
/.

So
I
really
wanted
to
get
out
and
address
that
and
offer
some
common
sense
approaches
/.

My
father
was
a
doctor
/.

I
messed
with
drugs
/.

Um
I
was
an
outsider
even
then
/.

I
played
her
in
a
film
with
Mickey
/.

I
was
never
married
to
Peter
Horton
/.

Way
to
make
a
living
/.

Um
no
I
have
not
ever
felt
that
/.

Did
n't
notice
it
/?

At
a
certain
point
I
was
just
completely
handicapped
/.

<ENAMEX
TYPE="PERSON">Linda
Hamilton
/.</ENAMEX>

What
was
the
turning
point
of
you
/?

So
I
--
um
my
family
doctor
was
a
tremendous
help
/.

No
they
're
not
the
same
at
all
/.

Um
they
teach
teams
--
going
around
teaching
teams
to
treat
people
with
mental
illnesses
with
the
whole
body
/.

The
pills
have
been
an
amazing
story
though
/.

and
we
need
to
just
get
as
informed
as
we
can
about
what
other
things
might
help
us
live
healthy
lives
/.

There
is
that
coming
up
I
hope
/.

Scottsdale
Arizona
hello
/.

Um
you
know
I
did
have
a
group
of
loving
and
supportive
friends
who
said
we
're
going
to
see
you
through
this
and
you
need
some
help
and
let
's
keep
looking
/.

and
I
am
so
very
glad
you
are
out
there
in
our
face
so
to
speak
and
letting
us
know
that
people
will
support
us
/.

and
every
year
is
just
richer
and
richer
because
I
'm
really
returning
to
who
who
I
was
meant
to
be
,
who
my
parents
raised
/.

What
was
it
whoever
tagged
who
first
/?

you
know
sometimes
they
're
misdiagnosed
with
ADD
/.

And
uh
I
found
that
to
be
true
/.

you
know
I
mean
I
do
n't
want
to
sound
like
I
'm
bragging
/.

I
'm
having
like
a
panic
attack
waiting
to
be
on
television
/.

but
I-
I
'm
very
sorry
to
hear
that
your
family
/-

I
'm
sorry
/.

I
do
n't
know
where
they
're
based
/.

Weight
gain
/?

So
what
you
want
to
do
is
learn
of
the
side
effects
early
so
that
you
can
do
certain
things
for
yourself
to
combat
them
/.

OK
/.

It
's
a
safe
bet
that
Sam
Brownbeck
is
going
to
vote
for
him
and
Charles
Schumer
is
going
to
vote
against
him
/.

Is
it
a
down
automatic
/?

But
I
think
that
there
's
--
I
think
both
Senators
are
I
think
exactly
right
to
say
we
're
going
to
wait
and
hold
our
positions
/.

and
it
's
going
to
take
some
time
to
see
/.

That
does
a
disservice
/.

but
I
think
that
's
an
unlikely
way
to
consider
it
/.

but
I
think
what
happened
here
is
not
a
single
senator
for
instance
said
that
uh
Harriet
Myers
'
nomination
should
be
withdrawn
/.

I
think
it
's
going
to
be
a
fight
for
both
sides
/.

The
book
is
Between
You
and
Me
/.

And
And
what
it
does
is
it
brings
the
Vice
President
into
play
/.

So
uh
have
you
been
subpoenaed
/?

See
Mike
/.

I
told
you
off
the
air
I
've
read
it
/.

and
what
he
had
said
about
her
/.

Well
the
people
at
--
um
it
was
--
it
really
was
good
/.

We
both
adore
her
very
well
and
admire
her
immensely
/.

And
yeah
she
fell
and
and
/-

and
we
'll
be
right
back
/.

Mmm
/.

the
time
has
come
/.

you
were
offered
the
job
of
press
secretary
by
Richard
Nixon
/.

And
uh
when
we
come
back
the
book
is
Between
You
and
Me
/.

Uh
you
had
mentioned
uh
that
you
find
it
rather
uh
odd
I
guess
the
silence
of
Dick
Cheney
or
maybe
not
so
odd
but
he
has
been
silent
/.

Why
would
we
put
them
at
peril
/?

Uh
and
I
'd
like
to
know
about
it
/.

Putin
/?

Interview
/.

It
it
was
like
a
little
bit
like
Regis
and
uh
Kathy
or
uh
Regis
and
Kelly
/.

I
I
think
probably
the
Aiatola
really
because
he
was
not
anxious
to
do
it
/.

they
knew
it
was
addictive
/.

That
's
why
I
feel
like
a
kid
compared
to
you
/.

Of
course
of
course
of
course
/.

Thank
you
Mike
/.

A
conversation
with
columnist
Tom
Friedman
/.

but
that
her
former
boss
says
no
way
/.

That
did
n't
happen
/.

Um
but
that
was
a
strange
request
/.

They
did
n't
say
that
sh-
you
know
until
until
she
walked
out
/.

you
know
I
've
been
talking
to
Judy
off
and
on
about
this
case
for
the
last
year
/.

We
've
got
to
figure
this
out
/.

It
's
very
clear
in
her
story
that
she
decided
finally
to
testify
because
she
got
tired
of
jail
because
she
was
threatened
with
criminal
contempt
charges
because
she
wanted
to
go
out
and
now
she
's
saying
admitting
finally
write
a
book
/.

It
's
about
trust
with
the
public
/.

I
I
would
prefer
that
people
keep
an
eye
on
what
the
test-
--
you
know
watching
him
testify
and
going
in
and
out
of
the
courthouse
/.

<ENAMEX

Fitzgerald

They
rehearsed
it
/.

And
we
are
also
using
soldiers
as
props
/.

Welcome
/.

Well
on
Friday
afternoon
/.

N-
no
in
fact
I
disparage
any
man
who
as
FBI
director
has
a
personal
pique
rather
than
doing
his
job
/.

President
Clinton
at
that
re-
uh
meeting
did
press
the
uh
Crown
Prince
to
cooperate
with
the
FBI
/.

We
appreciate
it
/.

They
were
returning
from
a
band
competition
at
the
University
of
Wisconsin
in
Whitewater
/.

I
'm
really
making
a
larger
point
which
is
about
the
war
on
terrorism
/.

Yeah
and
I
think
that
's
right
/.

I
was
guarded
uh
by
the
British
Royal
Marines
actually
because
unfortunately
they
've
had
now
um
uh
roadside
bombs
down
there
not
suicide
bombs
/.

I
care
passionately
about
this
story
/.

but
it
's
episodic
/.

/.

Yes
/.

It
's
just
become
uh
one
natural
disaster
after
another
/.

Mhm
/.

I
would
say
that
there
was
a
lot
of
ignoring
--
there
's
several
things
happened
basically
in
the
last
three
years
/.

/.

I
Howie
we
have
the
best
jo-
--
we
are
home
alone
okay
/.

Here
in
New
York
tonight
officials
say
they
are
increasing
security
on
the
city
's
massive
subway
system
because
of
what
they
call
a
significant
and
credible
threat
/.

When
we
come
back
one
network
up
the
river
without
an
explanation
/.

Live
from
CNN
in
Washington
this
is
Late
Edition
with
Wolf
Blitzer
/.

I
'm
Patricia
Whitfield
at
the
CNN
center
in
Atlanta
/.

What
what
we
have
to
do
is
have
the
right
number
of
troops
in
Iraq
/.

But
but
it
's
very
very
clear
to
me
that
we
're
going
to
stay
the
course
,
that
we
're
going
to
build
Iraqi
security
capacity
,
that
the
Iraqi
are
serious
about
being
partners
in
this
effort
and
they
're
very
serious
about
taking
over
the
effort
/.

There
is
n't
a
person
at
this
table
who
agrees
with
you
that
we
're
in
a
quagmire
and
that
there
's
no
end
in
sight
/.

There
are
people
that
support
the
insurgency
/.

there
's
a
division
that
are
fighting
--
that
is
fighting
down
in
the
Baghdad
area
/.

Corrupt
patchily
trained
and
equipped
often
abysmally
led
and
devoid
of
confidence
/.

I
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
would
characterize
it
as
a
dialog
between
US
officials
and
insurgents
/.

His
network
exists
inside
Iraq
/.

Uh
but
it
's
not
the
only
battle
/.

What
did
you
mean
by
that
/?

Iran
's
an
important
player
in
the
overall
scheme
of
the
Middle
East
/.

He
also
vowed
to
pursue
a
peaceful
nuclear
program
and
said
his
government
will
not
be
extremist
/.

Yeah
it
was
a
very
upbeat
assessment
/.

Uh
when
he
relies
on
the
dictionary
to
define
the
word
throes
he
's
leaving
out
the
word
that
he
put
before
throes
which
is
the
word
last
/.

And
this
administration
must
insist
/.

That
's
the
key
issue
/.

They
're
entitled
to
that
/.

I
'll
speak
with
that
country
's
President
Emile
Lahoud
/.

Two
other
<ENAMEX
TYPE="NORP"
S_OFF="5">anti-Syrian
personalities
were
assassinated
in
recent
weeks
/.

And
eh
another
thing
happened
only
a
few
months
before
the
assassination
of
president
/.

Another
one
could
be
our
permanent
enemy
/.

and
we
are
considering
the
possible
return
of
the
verification
team
to
ascertain
what
's
going
on
/.

one
of
them
is
the
presentation
of
the
Palestinians
who
are
in
Lebanon
/.

Log
onto
CNN
dot
com
slash
late
edition
to
cast
your
vote
/.

Meanwhile
in
England
police
today
arrested
six
more
terror
suspects
in
a
sweep
in
southern
England
/.

Uh
so
I
I
I
am
very
much
hopeful
that
we
will
meet
all
these
deadlines
/.

Is
that
true
/?

Uh
we
the
the
democracy
as
you
know
Wolf
is
the
rule
of
majority
/.

I
I
would
n't
like
to
uh
guess
a
figure
because
I
think
this
will
play
uh
into
the
terrorists
'
hands
as
well
as
it
's
unfair
/.

There
was
a
report
released
by
the
Pentagon
and
the
State
Department
this
past
week
on
Iraqi
military
preparedness
among
other
things
/.

I
I
I
ca
n't
ca
n't
deny
that
there
are
some
mistakes
/.

Well
eh
I
would
--
I
would
n't
like
to
eh
preempt
or
influence
the
trial
because
this
is
--
uh
this
is
independent
judicial
uh
process
and
I
would
not
like
to
to
uh
uh
apply
any
pressure
on
the
judge
uh
to
uh
speed
up
the
+trial
trial
/.

And
just
ahead
is
a
timetable
set
,
should
one
be
set
,
for
US
troops
to
start
leaving
Iraq
/?

And
here
in
Washington
Democratic
Senator
Joe
Lieberman
of
Connecticut
/.

Senator
Kyl
there
's
one
argument
that
's
being
made
that
the
Iraqis
would
be
better
off
with
a
much
smaller
US
military
footprint
there
/.

Um
maybe
I
believe
we
do
actually
need
uh
uh
an
increase
in
the
end
strength
of
our
Army
so
our
commanders
in
the
field
will
will
have
the
troops
they
need
as
the
facts
on
the
ground
dictate
/.

We
have
gone
uh
since
nine
eleven
without
an
attack
here
in
the
United
States
/.

We
've
got
to
do
more
to
improve
the
security
of
our
rail
and
transit
systems
/.

but
I
want
to
let
Senator
Lieberman
weigh
in
on
this
/.

Late
Edition
will
be
right
back
/.

Senator
Lieberman
is
it
a
good
idea
for
the
President
to
give
uh
John
Bolton
what
's
called
a
recess
appointment
skirting
the
US
Senate
as
the
next
US
ambassador
to
the
UN
/?

You
know
I
was
a
member
of
the
group
of
fourteen
uh
/.

He
knows
the
subject
very
well
/.

I
think
we
're
going
to
--
we
're
going
to
pass
it
by
more
than
the
two
thirds
required
to
overturn
an
expected
presidential
veto
/.

Wayne
Hale
welcome
to
Late
Edition
/.

So
as
of
right
now
we
have
not
taken
a
rescue
off
the
table
/.

We
looked
at
it
with
a
special
uh
high

to
look
at
any
small
voids
or
um
areas
where
the
glue
that
binds
it
to
the
uh
substrate
might
have
come
loose
/.

This
hardware
is
very
well
maintained
/.

Thanks
very
much
Mr.
Hale
for
joining
us
/.

Um
the
special
prosecutor
's
been
working
eighteen
months
/.

Could
you
have
been
subpeonaed
ah
and
threatened
with
jail
during
Watergate
/.

what
do
you
hear
/.

Yeah
sure
and
I
I
think
the
--
I
think
the
prosecutor
's
making
a
mistake
/.

Let
's
loo-
take
a
look
at
Monday
's
breifing
and
some
of
the
questions
about
Rove
/.

and
that
's
what
we
're
in
/.

but
he
had
taken
such
extreme
care
that
there
was
minimal
risk
/.

How
did
you
feel
when
more
recently
you
saw
that
FBI
memo
that
he
had
signed
saying
that
Woodward
and
Berstein
were
reporting
half
-
truths
and
fiction
and
we
need
to
find
the
leakers
this
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
meeting
privately
and
secretly
with
you
kind
of
duplicitous
/.

The
Weathermen
were
violent
/.

When
we
come
back
,
was
Mark
Felt
capable
of
informed
consent
in
releasing
his
long
held
secret
to
the
world
/?

and
I
felt
look
ah
his
life
is
fine
/.

And
my
regret
is
I
did
n't
get
out
there
sooner
and
sit
down
with
him
and
say
look
we
need
to
talk
about
this
/.

Well
I
ah
consulted
Ben
Bradley
the
former
editor
of
the
Post
/.

ah
people
are
claiming
they
have
inside
information
/.

I
mean
there
is
--
it
's
this
kind
of
secretive
shadowy
institution
/.

Look
at
that
/.

This
is
News
Night
/.

It
is
a
mystery
that
begins
high
in
the
Sierra
Nevada
Mountains
at
the
bottom
of
a
glacier
/.

Root
tips
are
are
closed
/.

Uh
you
can
see
all
these
letters
from
the
calendar
Sunday
Monday
Tuesday
up
at
the
top
one
nine
four
and
two
/.

is
that
true
/?

And
what
we
want
to
do
is
we
do
n't
want
to
just
look
at
the
material
evidence
that
we
have
and
immediately
make
a
--
um
jump
to
a
conclusion
that
this
is
a
certain
individual
/.

Hi
Erica
/.

and
I
'm
sure
I
'll
be
hearing
a
little
bit
more
about
it
all
week
/.

She
was
ninety
years
old
/.

Thirty
-
four
patients
were
left
behind
at
Saint
Rita
's
nursing
home
in
New
Orleans
when
Katrina
hit
/.

Nursing
homes
that
kill
residents
nursing
homes
that
um
seriously
injure
patients
um
because
of
bad
care
/.

Oh
I
'm
starving
you
know
/.

These
are
regular
toilets
/.

but
we
ca-
s-
--
we
can
say
something
about
how
you
feel
tonight
/.

There
has
been
at
least
consideration
for
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
before
a
stunt
/.

Turning
our
attention
now
to
something
that
has
a
lot
of
folks
concerned
/.

On
the
other
hand
to
be
able
to
outline
and
do
the
thing
that
were
talked
about
today
to
basically
completely
revamp
the
public
health
system
so
that
local
officials
can
talk
to
state
officials
that
can
talk
to
federal
officials
to
be
able
to
pinpoint
exactly
when
a
cluster
of
bird
flu
happens
that
takes
probably
a
lot
more
money
and
a
and
a
really
a
complete
revamping
of
our
public
health
systems
/.

Not
bird
flu
though
/.

Fitty
Cent
's
film
Get
Rich
or
Die
Trying
has
n't
even
hit
theaters
yet
/.

Now
similar
complaints
are
coming
from
Brooklyn
New
York
/.

and
I
'm
glad
/.

Come
here
Strovell
/.

and
the
Lieutenant
colonel
struggles
to
find
progress
/.

And
we
turn
our
attention
now
to
London
where
a
memorial
service
was
held
today
for
the
fifty
-
two
victims
of
the
bomb
attacks
in
the
city
's
public
transport
systems
back
in
July
/.

This
scene
of
walking
down
down
the
platform
and
down
the
tracks
with
lines
of
injured
people
walking
past
you
out
the
other
way
is
/-

so
it
'll
always
be
a
sense
of
regret
as
we
did
as
much
as
we
could
but
there
was
still
a
human
cost
and
there
's
nothing
that
we
'll
ever
be
able
to
do
about
it
/.

But
what
a
difference
a
TV
show
makes
especialy
when
that
show
is
a
flop
/.

I
think
she
can
be
saved
/.

But
when
it
comes
to
Camilla
gossip
columnists
can
get
pretty
catty
/.

The
new
chick
and
her
prince
started
the
day
with
a
visit
to

Zero

Good
evening

that
makes
it
a
big

as
well
/.

This

but
by
far
the

But
as
an
economist
at
the
conservative
Heritage
foundation
Tim
supports
an
idea
that
might
put
other
commuters
into
shock
/.

this
is
a
private

/.

Andy
th-
thanks
so
much
for
being
with
us
again
/.

They
do
n't
believe
a
lot
of
the
charges
are
true
/.

I
mean
one
point
three
million
Americans
work
at
Wal
-
Mart
/.

So
they
're
just
getting
up
to
speed
/.

Plus
he

co-founder
of
a
violent
street
gang

And
in
Los
Angeles
a
massive
protest
against
the
Bush
administration
shuts
down
parts
of
the
city

But
here
across
the
river
on
what
locals
call
the
West
Bank
they
have
different
problems
the
kind
you
do
n't
mind
having
like
where
to
get
coffee
or
go
shopping
/.

We
like
on
a
island
over
here

American
Morning
anchor
Miles
O'Brien

Kim

she

Really
you

just
talking
about

the
the

I
'd
fix
it
up

Tonight
on
Newsnight
politics
makes
strange
bedfellows

but
Nelson
and
other
Democrats
are
targets
of
opportunity
for
the
White
House
which
hopes
to
pad
Republican
support
for
Alito
with
enough
Democrats
to
discourage
and
if
needed
defeat
a
filibuster
/.

Also
the
survivors
of
that
massive
South
Asian
earthquake
are
facing
a
new
and
even
deadlier
if
you
can
believe
it
threat

Retired

Wes
McBride

six

The
odds
are
against
any
man
even
one
like
Tookie
Williams
who
was
nominated
for
a
Nobel
Peace
prize
/.

and
they
can
have
a
real
impact
on
some
of
the
younger
offenders
to
not
go
down
their
path
and
end
up
in

in

and
as
I
've
indicated
I
've
already
talked

of
a

I

How
are
Hong
Kong
's
relations
with
the
mainland
.

Basically
,
uh
,
this
,
world
famous
enterprises
,
as
well
as
domestic
enterprises
,
uh
,
were
,
were
all
present
.

Even
worse
,
eh
,
some
of
them
,
er
,
would
drill
holes
in
the
walls
,
sneak
into
the
military
garage
,
and
steal
a
number
of
license
plates
all
at
once
;
there
was
one
time
where
more
than
ten
plates
were
stolen
.

At
the
same
time
,
it
supports
the
tentative
idea
proposed
by
China
,
that
is
,
to
set
up
within
the
Six
Party
Talks
several
special
groups
to
discuss
different
issues
.

So
I
'm
somewhat
better
in
the
humanities
.

Uh-huh
.

Besides
these
eight
measures
by
the
Ministry
of
Public
Security
,
the
Ministry
of
Education
also
has
six
measures
.

If
we
do
not
buy
them
,
then
is
n't
it
true
that
there
is
no
such
problem
.

You
've
been
eyeing
that
lady
's
pocket
,
that
satchel
.

You
see
that
.

Oh
.

I
will
prepare
to
test
into
Harvard
.

Well
,
the
final
conclusion
,
eh
,
was
to
locate
it
in
France
.

Er
,
for
general
buying
and
selling
transactions
,
it
's
a
prison
sentence
of
,
er
,
less
than
three
years
.

Can
we
do
that
.

The
US
changed
in
that
it
established
the
North
American
Free
Trade
Zone
,
and
then
,
er
,
established
the
American
Free
Trade
Zone
.

Well
,
from
the
long
-
term
perspective
,
the
purpose
,
um
,
of
North
Korea
's
participation
in
the
six
-
party
talks
,
eh
,
is
also
to
resolve
issues
of
its
concern
through
the
process
,
eh
,
of
denuclearization
of
the
peninsula
.

Uh-huh
.

What
is
even
more
frightening
.

My
goodness
.

Starting
from
2006
and
up
until
the
present
,
no
less
than
ten
similar
incidents
have
been
reported
in
the
media
.

As
for
the
hybrid
motors
,
ah
,
this
time
I
observed
that
it
was
the
second
generation
hybrid
motors
that
had
been
put
in
the
products
,
ah
.

Uh-huh
.

This
caused
,
eh
,
a
lot
of
tension
in
the
Taiwanese
government
,
and
in
partiular
its
defense
department
had
put
forward
that
it
could
n't
be
sunk
.

Let
me
ask
a
question
you
in
return
,
ah
,
do
you
think
China
can
become
the
world
's
car
manufacturing
center
.

Well
,
this
time
it
may
be
exactly
the
opposite
.

Uh-huh
.

Wow
,
that
's
really
a
huge
profit
,
ah
.

Um
,
it
's
fair
to
say
that
the
British
media
is
giving
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
matter
.

She
said
that
although
she
felt
upset
,
she
would
still
get
herself
stronger
and
support
her
husband
.

That
is
to
say
,
in
order
to
sever
this
Internet
addiction
,
is
n't
the
best
way
to
help
them
find
an
effective
way
to
communicate
with
the
real
world
.

No
.

China
's
GDP
has
been
climbing
at
such
an
annual
rate
of
8
percent
,
9
percent
,
10
percent
,
and
this
has
been
for
twenty
years
already
.

Where
did
you
spend
the
money
.

Uh-huh
.

The
establishment
of
a
consolidated
emergency
center
.

What
do
you
mean
gratifying
,
Gosh
!

Right
,
Right
,
that
's
right
.

That
is
not
necessarily
a
question
of
being
advanced
or
backward
.

Er
,
or
I
should
say
that
the
investigation
is
,
eh
,
I
should
say
,
being
aggressively
carried
out
right
now
,
ah
.

But
now
,
as
for
the
various
companies
,
they
are
competing
against
each
other
,
ah
,
and
it
is
really
intense
.

This
institute
will
control
,
as
we
now
see
it
,
seven
local
branch
institutes
.

We
think
that
,
eh
,
it
is
exactly
,
eh
,
in
the
process
of
independent
innovation
,
then
,
we
ca
n't
completely
cut
ourselves
off
from
the
outside
world
.

Uh-huh
.

Right
,
there
was
a
lot
of
this
.

So
do
you
remember
,
when
you
,
Mr.
Xu
,
first
went
to
the
United
States
,
you
felt
that
the
Americans
were
so
abnormal
for
seeing
psychiatrists
even
for
minor
issues
.

Uh-huh
.

So
,
it
would
be
usually
difficult
to
spot
.

Right
.

Right
.

Right
.

The
South
Korean
side
has
always
had
this
difficulty
,
that
is
,
the
so
-
called
action
to
action
deal
.

In
the
past
,
uh
,
the
negotiations
,
uh
,
were
conducted
under
the
general
suspicion
that
North
Korea
had
nuclear
weapons
and
a
nuclear
program
.

Yes
.

He
cooks
,
we
both
like
to
cook
.

Your
family
is
very
democratic
.

Um
,
um
,
er
,
paying
tuition
by
oneself
and
finding
a
job
by
oneself
,
um
,
started
in
1995
.

Er
,
so
,
now
they
have
already
started
to
establish
an
financial
aid
system
for
students
from
impoverished
households
,
chiefly
focusing
on
student
loans
,
a
system
with
scholarships
,
er
,
student
grants
,
tuition
waivers
or
reductions
,
and
work
-
study
.

Speaking
about
checking
auto
showgirls
,
ah
,
I
participated
in
the
Paris
Auto
Show
at
the
end
of
September
.

Uh
.

Good
morning
/.

Will
there
be
an
investigation
as
to
who
leaked
the
information
to
the
Russians
/?

Does
the
president
still
believe
that
President
Putin
is
straightforward
and
trustworthy
/?

We
're
working
through
it
/.

I
'll
tell
you
who
does
n't
think
that
/.

There
are
--
there
are
a
lot
of
uh
options
once
you
're
in
the
Security
Council
/.

Um
I
do
n't
think
anyone
um
knew
precisely
what
we
would
be
facing
in
terms
of
numbers
/.

Saddam
Hussein
's
last
foreign
minister
Naji
Sabri
paid
spy
for
<ENAMEX
TYPE="NORP"
S_OFF="1">+French
intelligence
later
turned
him
over
to
the
CIA
to
supply
information
about
Iraq
its
chemical
biological
nuclear
weapon
program
more
than
six
months
before
the
war
began
in
March
of
oh
three
according
{to}
former
intelligence
officials
/.

and
I
think
they
're
going
to
succeed
/.

Ah
I
do
n't
think
that
there
is
anyone
--
I
I
do
not
think
that
he
was
in
a
box
/.

So
Iraqi
forces
are
getting
better
/.

Uh
a
few
violent
people
can
always
uh
grab
headlines
and
can
always
kill
innocent
people
/.

They
've
been
very
aware
um
of
the
issue
and
of
the
concerns
about
the
issue
/.

Tim
I
am
I
hate
to
say
fifty
one
years
old
/.

and
women
were
not
being
educated
uh
at
all
/.

You
just
announced
your
candidacy
/.

I-
Tim
ah
I
think
we
've
been
through
this
conversation
about
two
thousand
and
eight
/.

and
what
are
the
potential
pitfalls
for
politicians
as
they
try
to
navigate
the
issue
/?

We
'll
see
some
of
them
next
week
/.

You
know
in
two
thousand
Florida
Florida
Florida
/.

They
just
want
to
focus
on
another
car
bomb
/.

The
other
parts
of
it
do
get
told
/.

Yes
I
mean
s-
I
mean
I
'm
d-
--
I
'm
--
these
are
gradations
here
in
Wh-
--
in
White
House
response
/.

Ouch
/.

so
i-
that
's
/-

Republicans
thirty
-
seven
percent
/.

I
mean
eighty
-
five
percent
of
all
incumbent
senators
get
reelected
/.

But
redistricting
and
the
incumbency
advantages
that
have
built
over
the
years
just
make
pulling
this
kind
of
win
hard
unless
it
's
a
category
four
or
five
/.

and
there
's
a
hearing
/.

I
think
Democrats
would
be
crazy
from
a
political
standpoint
to
offer
up
proposals
/.

Is
n't
that
the
Republicans
'
hope
David
that
by
October
enough
troops
have
come
home
the
President
can
then
give
a
speech
that
w-
says
you
see
/.

The
Patriots
/.

Alright
ye-
you
sure
are
/.

This
is
the
main
smuggling
route
for
insurgents
from
the
Syrian
border
into
central
Iraq
/.

The
central
issue
was
Iraq
/.

I
'm
David
Shuster
for
Hardball
in
Washington
/.

He
was
painting
himself
as
a
Republican
/.

I
think
that
the
finish
line
is
is
in
sight
/.

But
they
also
want
to
talk
about
other
issues
issues
like
taxes
and
tax
reform
like
a
strong
energy
policy
/.

And
what
does
it
say
about
the
public
support
for
the
war
right
now
/?

I
think
--
uh
I
think
the
Secretary
of
State
of
your
state
seems
like
he
's
trashing
George
Bush
who
's
running
a
half
billion
dollar
half
trillion
dollar
deficit
for
not
being
a
real
conservative
/.

He
stood
with
his
commander
in
chief
/.

and
one
is
an
independent
/.

What
's
it
like
for
the
prisoners
/?

And
I
'm
like
why
's
the
door
open
/?

But
they
make
a
big
deal
about
how
much
negotiating
is
been
doing
/.

All
fourteen
marines
were
from
the
same
reserve
unit
based
near
Cleveland
Ohio
/.

Major
league
baseball
does
n't
agree
/.

They
do
n't
have
enough
information
enough
knowledge
on
how
long
a
metabolyte
lasts
in
an
athlete
's
system
/.

Uh
so
we
have
n't
actually
got
him
in
/.

He
still
makes
over
two
point
eight
million
dollars
a
year
/.

I
never
say
anything
/.

But
that
's
--
that
's
not
the
typical
position
of
unions
/.

You
know
he
had
the
Hall
of
Fame
and
the
three
thousand
hits
and
the
endorsements
and
uh
really
the
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
entire
country
/.

Ed
Rogers
is
a
Republican
political
consultant
who
served
in
the
first
Bush
White
House
/.

and
the
country
wo
n't
accept
it
/.

So
/-

It
shows
that
Rudy
Giuliani
has
got
a
sixty
four
percent
sixty
four
percent
favor
in
this
environment
when
everybody
's
tough
on
politicians
/.

Yeah
/.

but
in
nineteen
fifty
-
two
the
Republicans
looked
at
probable
defeat
/.

Stay
with
us
/.

Do
you
think
she
's
the
strongest
Democratic
candidate
for
two
thousand
and
eight
Bob
Shrum
/?

Oh
okay
well
that
helps
everybody
right
yeah
/.

I
do
n't
know
if
The
Daily
Show
is
calling
the
shots
Bob
Shrum
/.

You
know
in
Feb-
t-
--
uh
in
February
and
March
of
two
thousand
and
eight
pragmatism
and
a
calculating
--
a
collective
calculus
on
behalf
of
Republican
primary
voters
will
not
be
what
carries
the
day
/.

Ah
he
is
--
he
's
/-

this
is
exactly
what
I
want
at
the
United
Nations
/.

And
and
in
fact
it
's
the
vice
president
who
's
very
close
to
John
Bolton
,
who
has
been
a
real
stalwart
for
him
throughout
this
process
/.

The
time
was
to
do
it
now
/.

Uh
John
Bolton
will
be
there
during
probably
the
most
important
time
for
the
United
Nations
in
many
many
years
/.

Do
you
worry
about
him
rattling
the
cage
of
uh
the
head
of
North
Korea
with
comments
like
he
's
a
tyrannical
dictator
/?

that
's
the
--
that
's
the
approach
we
're
going
to
use
/.

That
's
what
that
was
all
about
/.

On
the
other
hand
we
need
to
work
with
the
UN
/.

So
we
need
an
effective
United
Nations
/.

This
president
has
more
disdain
for
the
United
States
Congress
than
any
president
I
've
seen
in
my
thirty
years
there
/.

Republicans
said
his
Bolton
's
skepticism
of
the
UN
combined
with
his
hard
working
style
would
make
him
a
perfect
choice
/.

He
will
have
the
Brits
and
some
of
the
other
traditional
American
allies
/.

What
Rice
is
proving
as
secretary
is
that
she
's
much
more
pragmatic
as
secretary
of
state
than
she
was
a
national
security
adviser
on
Iran
and
on
North
Korea
/.

Well
because
they
've
--
they
've
learned
from
their
mistake
/.

Have
you
got
a
party
on
taxes
on
trade
on
anything
/?

you
've
had
sustained
growth
for
the
last
two
years
/.

He
's
basically
going
to
waste
the
other
side
the
Third
World
people
and
just
and
just
blow
them
up
every
night
/.

Your
party
stuck
by
what
you
just
said
about
blaming
John
Bolton
for
the
war
/.

He
's
not
going
to
get
reupped
/.

and
I
think
that
's
absolutely
right
/.

/.

By
the
way
/-

In
fact
he
was
originally
uh
an
appointee
of
the
president
's
father
/.

As
bad
as
FDR
in
the
second
term
/?

I
think
the
differences
of
opinion
here
/-

What
did
you
--
what
did
you
get
from
the
Iraqis
/?

And
I
think
reporters
need
to
really
continue
to
go
outside
their
area
of
comfortability
outside
the
Green
Zone
/.

I
was
in
Bejing
when
when
college
students
were
being
murdered
/.

I
have
n't
been
over
there
/.

the
French
did
not
/.

Go
in
not
go
in
or
go
in
with
greater
strength
/.

and
we
hear
that
from
a
lot
of
people
Bill
Kristol
John
McCain
/.

All
of
these
things
that
fourteen
members
of
our
entourage
did
/-

they
're
too
dangerous
to
deal
with
/.

I
'm
--
I
'm
trying
to
respond
to
/-

when
you
go
on
televsion
with
people
because
they
want
to
be
loyal
to
their
units
and
their
their
service
/.

No
complications
/.

Right
/.

It
's
always
fun
on
Friday
night
here
/.

He
did
not
say
a
word
throughout
the
entire
hearing
/.

Imette
was
a
good
person
a
kind
person
/.

They
were
staring
straight
ahead
as
well
/.

Yes
it
was
close
to
closing
time
/.

Further
a
witness
said
he
saw
a
van
that
matched
the
description
of
the
one
used
by
Littlejohn
making
a
u-turn
at
about
seven
thirty
PM
at
the
place
Imette
's
body
was
found
/.

If
the
--
if
the
theory
is
that
she
was
raped
and
killed
why
is
n't
Littlejohn
's
DNA
all
over
her
body
/?

They
they
start
saying
aha
prove
the
rape
prove
the
rape
/.

a
woman
called
when
she
saw
his
picture
on
the
television
/.

All
right
All
right
/.

uh
The
investigation
uh
is
certainly
still
going
forward
/.

It
's
going
to
be
a
tough
argument
in
part
because
the
original
story
that
the
bar
manager
told
cops
was
that
he
--
was
that
he
'd
seen
Imette
leave
alone
/.

Now
she
is
furious
at
the
judge
/.

and
this
is
just
a
bump
in
the
road
/.

nobody
likes
to
testify
/.

Every
fourteen
year
old
this
would
be
his
dream
/.

No
he
did
n't
/.

Well
that
's
what
I
find
ironic
that
I
I
appreciate
her
concern
for
my
son
/.

but
/-

He
has
n't
registered
his
address
to
the
state
/.

Now
back
to
the
Abrams
report
/.

and
I
love
him
/.

And
she
says
for
the
next
four
years
she
was
locked
in
a
bedroom
/.

But
she
does
say
she
had
sex
with
him
when
she
was
a
child
,
right
/?

And
the
side
is
that
we
have
a
man
who
has
never
been
involved
in
any
crime
in
his
lifetime
/.

I
I
I
did
n't
know
that
/.

And
I
think
if
you
were
representing
him
you
would
n't
be
saying
it
either
/.

How
did
she
come
to
then
/?

Yeah
/.

President
Bush
not
happy
about
this
/.

In
Afghanistan
there
is
a
power
struggle
going
on
between
those
who
want
to
bring
the
country
back
into
the
community
of
nations
and
make
it
modern
and
democratic
country
and
the
Islamic
conservatives
who
have
really
run
the
country
uh
for
the
last
decade
/.

And
in
the
final
negotiations
they
actually
made
the
document
even
more
Islamic
and
made
the
judiciary
even
more
powerful
um
than
what
the
original
draft
has
done
/.

Alex
Thier
thanks
a
lot
for
coming
on
the
program
/.

The
web
site
the
Smoking
Gun
obtained
the
items
Cheney
requires
and
required
is
underlined
for
his
quote
downtime
/.

It
's
got
me
thinking
I
should
make
some
demands
of
my
own
/.

I
know
my
producers
are
probably
like
ah
uh
/.

Some
say
they
now
fear
a
racial
backlash
because
Davis
the
suspect
was
black
and
the
officers
appear
white
mistrust
that
may
threaten
the
fragile
recovery
in
a
town
that
has
already
been
through
enough
/.

But
uh
let
me
a-
--
Captain
i-
i-
is
it
fair
to
a-
--
to
to
ask
the
question
are
some
on
the
police
department
kind
of
losing
it
/?

You
know
anything
about
that
/?

Eddie
Jordan
Jr.
is
the
New
Orleans
district
attorney
/.

an-
and
it
it
it
certainly
demands
some
explanation
/.

and
these
are
cops
who
literally
slept
in
their
car
for
twenty
four
hour
shifts
/.

if
can
pull
this
one
up
/.

You
're
s-
simply
saying
that
you
think
it
's
something
that
should
be
evaluated
as
a
defense
attorney
,
right
/.

And
Richmond
police
also
looking
for
another
teenage
girl
Monica
Sharp
went
out
for
a
walk
with
her
dog
weeks
ago
/.

Thank
you
for
inviting
me
/.

Ha-
have
you
gotten
the
impression
uh
that
from
the
beginning
that
he
was
the
one
they
were
looking
at
/?

that
she
was
not
there
was
a
reason
for
her
not
calling
us
/.

Um
why
is
it
that
--
why
are
are
the
authorities
do
you
think
so
confident
uh
that
she
is
with
him
/?

and
we
showed
you
the
picture
um
of
the
man
that
she
is
uh
suspected
of
being
with
Jeffrey
Nichols
/.

Hello
I
'm
Bill
Fitzgerald
/.

James
Dobson
founder
of
the
conservative
Evangelical
group
Focus
On
The
Family
said
last
week
on
his
radio
show
that
he
's
got
some
inside
info
/.

and
I
ca
n't
imagine
that
uh
Jim
Dobson
did
either
/.

I
suspect
that
what
Dobson
found
out
leads
him
to
believe
that
she
will
vote
the
way
he
wants
her
to
to
overturn
Roe
versus
Wade
and
do
a
lot
of
those
things
/.

Of
course
I
'm
/-

Jay
Sekulow
go
ahead
/.

I
'm
not
--
and
I
'm
not
questioning
--
I
'm
n-
--
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
suggesting
he
's
not
going
to
tell
the
truth
/.

One
condition
he
had
to
have
weekly
contact
with
probation
/.

and
the
time
is
now
/.

and
this
situation
would
not
have
happened
/.

They
let
him
out
/.

Authorities
need
your
finding
Clifford
Willard
convicted
of
lewd
acts
with
a
child
under
the
age
of
fourteen
/.

So
instead
the
twenty
two
senators
who
opposed
Roberts
claimed
that
they
could
n't
vote
for
him
because
they
did
n't
know
enough
about
him
or
said
he
had
n't
answered
their
questions
/.

Tabs
Rush
/.

Hi
everyone
/.

He
seems
to
also
be
insistent
that
he
saw
something
/.

Well
tha-
tha-
was-
tha-
that
's
the
question
I
have
for
you
Michelle
/.

Um
you
know
the
the
main
thing
to
to
sum
it
up
as
you
know
Joran
how
he
entered
this
establishment
/.

Now
i-
/.

and
they
panicked
and
and
then
went
forth
and
did
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
/.

Um
Jossy
Mansur
produced
and
showed
me
a
copy
of
that
statement
that
uh
Joran
Van
Der
Sloot
made
um
the
last
time
that
I
was
here
in
Aruba
/.

Alright
/.

TJ
/.

And
it
's
been
a
month
since
this
man
went
missing
on
a
honeymoon
on
a
Mediterranean
cruise
/.

That
's
correct
/.

Come
on
/.

and
he
seemed
concerned
about
whether
or
not
we
reviewed
the
tape
/.

And
that
's
why
you
did
n't
believe
this
story
/.

What
do
you
make
of
all
this
/?

I
mean
if
the
jurors
were
tampering
with
evidence
,
if
they
were
playing
with
evidence
et
cetera
back
there
the
prosecutors
have
to
just
suck
it
up
and
be
depressed
/.

Okay
here
here
here
's
my
problem
/.

If
jurors
realize
that
there
's
--
tha-
that
there
's
a
back
end
if
you
will
which
is
a
Hollywood
term
to
these
trials
and
if
they
get
caught
so
what
they
get
caught
but
they
can
still
publish
a
book
if
they
believe
that
everything
is
going
to
change
in
this
city
/.

For
two
reasons
/.

but
first
the
headlines
/.

However
we
've
been
asked
by
the
authorities
not
to
speak
with
the
media
while
the
investigation
is
pending
/.

Uh
first
I
'd
just
like
to
clarify
I
'm
a
police
chief
in
Oak
Hill
Florida
not
Orlando
/.

Mhm
/.

Larry
so
any
uh
any
chance
now
based
on
the
fact
that
things
have
been
cleaned
up
et
cetera
to
to
get
any
usable
evidence
/?

This
is
again
from
Cletus
Hyman
uh
who
was
literally
um
in
a
--
in
a
joining
or
nearby
cabin
um
as
to
what
he
heard
around
he
said
four
in
the
morning
the
day
before
uh
Mister
Smith
went
missing
/.

All
week
we
've
been
continuing
with
our
series
Manhunt
Sex
Offenders
on
the
Loose
/.

Samantha
Runnion
was
uh
just
eleven
days
away
from
her
sixth
birthday
when
she
was
kidnapped
sexually
assaulted
and
murdered
by
a
man
named
Alejandro
Avila
/.

I
think
most
do
not
realize
how
pervasive
the
problem
is
/.

Yeah
/.

It
it
adds
to
state
revenue
/.

It
's
because
of
what
both
of
you
are
doing
to
have
things
change
/.

Absolutely
/.

Uh
No
/.

Oh
please
you
ever
wondered
how
to
get
back
at
the
police
for
writing
you
a
speeding
ticket
/?

I
will
never
in
my
lifetime
learn
why
a
serial
killer
becomes
a
serial
killer
/.

Mr.
Ambassador
good
morning
/.

That
strikes
us
as
an
obvious
point
/.

And
so
we
think
we
're
far
better
off
working
within
the
framework
of
the
six
party
talks
because
you
get
in
that
process
the
combined
leverage
the
combined
strength
and
frankly
the
combined
pressure
on
North
Korea
of
all
these
different
countries
/.

They
tried
to
fire
the
longer
range
missile
the
/.

Oh
I
do
n't
think
it
was
coincidental
/.

It
is
acting
in
defiance
of
all
its
own
international
commitments
/.

Would
you
acknowledge
a
significant
increase
in
the
nuclear
capability
by
North
Korea
on
the
watch
of
President
Bush
/?

and
we
believe
it
that
that
it
has
produced
that
over
the
last
several
years
/.

I
will
not
wait
on
events
while
dangers
gather
/.

I
got
a
visceral
reaction
to
this
guy
/.

They
've
miscalculated
because
you
've
seen
very
tough
statements
from
the
Chinese
and
the
Russians
and
the
South
Koreans
and
the
Japanese
against
what
they
've
done
/.

not
in
the
case
of
North
Korea
not
in
the
case
of
Iran
/.

And
I
disagree
for
one
reason
/.

They
are
all
right
here
next
only
on
Meet
The
Press
/.

They
are
a
desolate
isolated
regime
/.

Efforts
to
set
up
bench
marks
in
exchange
for
that
armistice
agreement
where
we
do
n't
attack
North
Korea
/.

This
is
kind
of
a
rule
I
think
that
you
you
really
try
hard
not
to
negotiate
with
a
gun
or
missile
to
your
head
/.

So
they
've
been
running
wild
for
three
years
or
so
/.

who
knows
/.

I
think
if
we
are
seriously
attacked
or
threatened
,
that
missile
which
was
a
test
was
geared
to
the
United
States
or
to
our
allies
we
have
allied
responsibilities
with
South
Korea
or
Japan
/.
/.

You
said
as
days
go
by
I
do
n't
believe
they
're
going
to
do
it
/.

and
it
is
the
process
that
is
required
to
hold
uh
countries
accountable
/.

Plutonium
production
was
stopped
/.

Nobody
did
that
deal
in
ninety
four
thinking
we
were
trusting
North
Koreans
/.

But
then
later
he
called
him
Mister

So
you
have
the
possibility
if
the
North
Koreans
are
thinking
the
way
they
may
be
thinking
that
they
need
one
or
the
other
,
they
need
either
nuclear
weapons
to
deter
the
United
States
from
regime
change
or
they
need
a
relationship
with
us
that
makes
it
unnecessary
for
them
to
have
nuclear
weapons
/.

A
lot
of
people
are
starving
there
/.

Coming
next
,
President
Bush
celebrated
his
sixtieth
birthday
this
week
/.

I
believe
you
ought
to
look
at
the
person
how
strong
he
is
mentally
and
physically
what
is
his
experience
and
what
his
background
is
/.

It
was
n't
a
matter
of
murdering
your
spouse
/.

That
's
our
report
/.

Well
first
and
most
importantly
the
decision
did
not
require
the
President
to
release
the
prisoners
at
Guantanamo
/.

The
world
is
a
different
place
/.

But
we
are
signatories
to
the
Geneva
Conventions
/.

Because
it
's
just
been
such
a
black
eye
diplomatically
/.

Well
let
me
turn
to
another
controversy
which
is
the
battle
over
national
security
leaks
/.

And
as
a
founding
father
said
when
they
first
wrote
the
Constitution
true
to
this
day
that
's
a
good
thing
for
America
/.

Yeah
/.

uh
Even
though
the
Journal
had
itself
published
uh
the
same
story
about
terror
financing
in
its
news
columns
which
is
separate
from
its
editorial
pages
/.

But
there
's
a
second
point
here
/.

so
wait
a
second
/.

They
do
want
a
timetable
for
bringing
home
the
troops
/.

Well
certainly
the
uh
the
taking
of
Iraq
was
went
as
expected
/.

Well
I
'd
rather
have
a
comprehensive
bill
than
not
/.

Now
let
me
show
you
a
bit
of
a
new
ad
that
the
Lamont
campaign
is
airing
which
morphs
Joe
Lieberman
with
uh
pictures
of
President
Bush
/.

But
only
for
the
primary
/.

Weigh
weigh
weigh
in
on
this
one
/.

We
're
going
to
have
this
debate
with
the
American
people
/.

We
spent
all
day
Friday
together
going
through
the
flood
uh
torn
areas
/.

uh
For
years
the
President
and
the
Treasury
have
been
trumpeting
their
success
in
following
terror
money
/.

I
want
to
ask
Bill
Safire
to
weigh
in
on
this
/.

September
twenty
-
fourth
two
thousand
one
President
Bush
walked
into
the
Rose
Garden
and
announced
we
've
developed
a
strategy
/.

I
'm
sorry
/.

But
it
also
led
to
William
Bennett
sitting
here
saying
that
three
reporters
who
won
the
Pulitzer
Prize
you
for
that
story
and
Jim
Risen
and
others
for
another
story
were
not
worthy
of
an
award
but
rather
worthy
of
jail
/.

I
think
that
is
a
uh
disgrace
/.

uh
Now
here
here
's
the
President
say
that
who
knew
that
the
the
details
of
this
program
/?

To
hold
things
back
/.

The
difference
is
the
government
was
elected
/.

big
big
big
part
of
the
story
they
got
wrong
/.

Wait
/.

uh
They
came
up
with
this
Bill
of
Rights
beyond
which
uh
the
constitutional
convention
would
not
move
unless
there
were
a
First
Amendment
to
challenge
the
government
just
as
the
American
Founding
Fathers
challenged
the
British
government
/.

Fifty
-
five
to
thirty
the
American
people
said
they
've
taken
the
right
approach
/.

Oh
you
're
saying
get
after
them
/.

When
you
--
when
you
drive
by
down
that
road
it
is
always
right

Some
of
the
top
people
of
The
New

Times
were
hired
from
The
Wall
Street
Journal

It
's
not
just
the
tactical
question

The
last
word
to
you
Bill
Bennett

And
we
are
back

Our

~~~

and
i
promise
to
fess
up
eventually
and
tell
of
at
least
one
such
epic
i
survived
--

Just
as
the
last
light
faded
we
made
it
to
the
place
where
a
trail
left
the
water
and
led
back
to
the
car
now
a
couple
hundred
meters
above
us
.

I
do
however
have
the
disconcerting
feeling
that
you
read
my
diary
though
.

for
the
guy
behind
the
-LRB-
bullet
proof
glass
--
big
earl
himself
?
-RRB-
at
first
said
'
50
bucks
an
hour
.
'

warren
was
magically
,
well
,
different
.

like
broken
hips
,
femurs
,
even
-LRB-
in
one
case
-RRB-
a
snapped
spine
--
all
trauma
endured
as
children
as
now
easily
proved
given
'
modern
'
techniques
.

beats
even
the
contents
of
the
``
Plan
R
Survival
Kit
''
Slim
Pickins
'
inventories
in
Dr.
Stranglove
.

it
got
suddenly
pitch
black
inside
the
car
as
every
inch
of
glass
was
buried
in
cow
shit
.

,
oh
,
yeah
,
and
the
guy
looking
for
his
cow
with
a
hatchet
,
but
the
epic
status
was
compromised
when
we
were
descending
the
mountain
and
met
the
schoolgirls
coming
up
it
on
their
way
home
.

I
drove
up
a
hill

I
could
feel
three
knife
points
against
my
back

I
was
fatigued
and
sleepy
;

They
all
had
photographs
of
Chief
Awolowo
pinned
on
their
shirts
.

At
this
one
,
though
,
I
had
n't
even
managed
to
announce
my
desire
to
join
UPGA
before
I
received
a
pair
of
hooks
to
the
midsection
and
had
my
shirt
torn
.

UPGA
is
power
!
'

But
now
I
was
out
of
money
for
ransom
,

There
was
no
turning
...

For
a
change
of
pace
,
I
invite
you
to
contemplate
the
hazard
posed
by
that
old
computer
monitor
sitting
in
your
basement
or
the
pre-big
screen
TV
collecting
dust
in
your
garage
.

I
have
always
thought
we
should
consider
setting
up
recycling
``
incubators
''
at
landfills
and
transfer
stations
.

and
it
has
a
waste
stream
of
its
own
.

Recall
the
story
of
mandatory
newspaper
recycling
in
the
District
.

A
windshiel
wiper
motor
installed
in
a
totally
inaccessible
place
under
the
dash
.

and
that
is
just
for
one
job
.

My
perspective
is
entirely
based
on
what
I
see
,
on
what
I
read
and
on
the
fact
that
my
family
has
lived
in
this
region
for
almost
200
years
.

They
have
a
land
area
larger
than
either
the
US
or
all
of
Europe
.

*1
.

We
may
arrange
for
the
best
airport
security
in
the
world
.

Suicide
murders
also
have
nothing
to
do
with
poverty
and
despair
.

The
unity
of
the
Civilized
World
in
fighting
this
horror
is
absolutely
indispensable
.

Incitement
by
Arab
TV
,
accompanied
by
horror
pictures
of
mutilated
bodies
,
has
become
a
powerful
weapon
of
those
who
lie
,
distort
and
want
to
destroy
everything
.

He
is
now
being
outperformed
by
his
successors
.

You
meet
their
children
in
the
best
private
schools
in
Europe
,
not
in
the
training
camps
of
suicide
murderers
.

Do
you
shoot
back
at
someone
trying
to
kill
you
,
standing
deliberately
behind
a
group
of
children
?

The
picture
I
described
here
is
not
pretty
.

This
is
a
significant
strategic
change
and
it
applies
strong
pressure
on
the
terrorist
countries
.

It
is
important
to
monitor
all
donations
from
the
Western
World
to
Islamic
organizations
,
to
monitor
the
finances
of
international
relief
organizations
and
to
react
with
forceful
economic
measures
to
any
small
sign
of
financial
aid
to
any
of
the
three
circles
of
terrorism
.

Here
's
a
classic
Rumsfeldism
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
:

In
Rumsfeld
's
case
,
behind
the
image
of
corporate
savior
lay
a
far
more
relevant
and
ominous
history
.

He
had
been
on
a
short
list
to
become
Ronald
Reagan
's
running
mate
in
the
1980
presidential
campaign
when
the
candidate
unexpectedly
reached
for
his
defeated
primary
rival
-LRB-
and
Rumsfeld
nemesis
-RRB-
George
H.W.
Bush
.

In
addition
to
the
usual
extensive
intelligence
-
sharing
with
Israel
's
Mossad
,
less
than
two
years
before
Rumsfeld
's
Iraq
mission
CIA
operatives
had
literally
lit
the
way
for
Israeli
F
fighter
bombers
in
their
June
1981
surprise
attack
on
Saddam
's
fledgling
nuclear
reactor
at
Osiraq
.

Historians
will
only
guess
at
the
rancor
building
in
these
two
deeply
ambitious
,
deeply
disappointed
figures
at
the
president
they
had
,
George
W.
Bush
,
whom
they
no
doubt
saw
as
manifestly
,
maddeningly
inferior
.

Mastery

Marshall
was
archetypical
in
the
career
-
making
fear
and
folly
of
the
U.S.
-
Russian
mirror
-
image
rivalry
.

History
will
unravel
only
slowly
Rumsfeld
's
relationship
to
the
neocons
,
who
dominated
the
middle
and
upper
reaches
of
his
Pentagon
,
a
relationship
more
complex
than
contemporary
hagiographies
or
demonologies
have
had
it
.

As
in
so
much
else
in
his
long
record
,
Rumsfeld
enjoyed
,
by
Washington
's
inimitable
mix
of
careerism
and
cowardice
,
submission
and
opportunism
,
a
large
supporting
cast
in
his
folly
.

Not
since
the
British
hired
hordes
of
Hessians
to
crush
George
Washington
's
revolutionary
army
had
a
military
force
tracing
to
America
been
so
utterly
mercenary
.

``
Beats
me
.
''

Speaking
of
buildings
,
for
a
current
show
in
Pasadena
,
Carlos
Mollura
has
inserted
polyethylene
cubes
,
spheres
and
other
geometric
shapes
into
architectural
orifices
at
a
Colorado
Boulevard
shopping
plaza
.

Many
of
these
artists
do
evoke
a
world
coming
apart
at
the
seams
.

The
landmark
exhibition
of
Robert
Rauschenberg
's
1950s
hybrids
of
painting
and
sculpture
that
closed
recently
at
the
Museum
of
Contemporary
Art
convinced
me
of
that
.

America
's
political
battles
of
the
past
20
years
may
center
on
attempts
to
repeal
or
defend
the
dramatic
changes
wrought
during
the
1960s
,
but
our
robust
artistic
bounty
today
is
its
resplendent
legacy
.

Right
on
.

That
suggests
sprawl
will
continue
,
as
will
the
demand
for
more
and
more
roads
and
other
infrastructure
.

I
know
where
I
live
in
the
outer
suburbs
that
there
IS
a
big
disparity
in
the
opposite
sense
.

That
's
why
people
pay
a
premium
to
live
in
a
central
location
--

The
answer
is
always
going
to
be
``
the
newcomer
.
''

I
found
this
rather
odd
in
that
the
concept
of
``
near
''
is
apparently
perceived
differently
depending
on
whether
you
were
an
employer
or
an
employee
.

It
does
that
by
offering
a
lower
level
of
service
and
less
comfort
-LRB-
standing
room
only
-RRB-
.

Even
when
land
is
publicly
owned
,
we
ca
n't
count
on
conservation
continuing
.

There
,
the
existing
residents
have
not
paid
enough
to
support
the
common
use
land
and
common
use
infrastructure
,
with
the
result
that
these
communities
are
now
resorting
to
assessing
additional
fees
,
but
only
on
newcomers
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
newcomers
pay
for
their
own
infrastructure
,
especially
if
we
*require*
them
to
pay
for
their
own
infrastructure
,
then
we
should
not
be
too
surprised
if
they
claim
to
own
it
and
wish
to
exclude
us
.

They
are
,
instead
,
maintained
.

Bacque
did
not
enumerate
those
opportunities
in
his
article
,

Furthermore
the
infrastructure
is
privately
owned
so
they
can
gouge
all
they
want
.

The
idea
is
rail
on
the
Southside
to
take
the
Port
of
Norfolk
containers
.

Health
insurance
,
retirement
funds
,
sick
leave
,
uniforms
,
and
a
huge
HR
department
to
make
sure
all
those
federal
regulations
are
followed
it
but
the
opening
salvo
.

If
this
catches
on
,
we
will
live
to
regret
the
day
.

and
there
are
many

Politicians

The
only
way
an
industrial
power
can
take
on
another
with
ten
times
its
population
base
is
by
using
what
it
thinks
is
its
overwhelming
advantage

From

blog
:

Jim
Brown
machine
-
gunned
him
for
messing
with
a
German
woman
in
a
simple
act
of
field
justice
.

Kind
of
Bart
or
Lisa
's
age
back
in
the
days
of
the
original
simpsons
.

-AMP-
we
were
too
damn
lazy
to
uncover
the
bill
of
goods
.

In
a
normal
society
,
people
show
care
and
love
for
one
another
,
hold
life
in
awe
and
veneration
and
give
thanks
to
God
.

They
actually
promoted
communists
in
the
OSS
,
which
was
started
by
William
Donovan
.

One
practical
result
of
Mao
was
the
cultural
revolution
.

Truth
is
soldiers
do
horrible
things
in
war
.

First
of
all
,
every
war
has
its
share
of
atrocities
and
massacres
,
on
both
sides
.

and
the
higher
-
ups
have
covered
this
by
saying
drivel
and
b*llshit
such
as
:
``
We
do
n't
torture
people
in
America
.
''

Yes

Is
Harry
Truman
in
heaven
?

all
of
you
who
'd
like
to
bash
God
or
demons
or
angels
or
aliens
need
to
look
into
the
mirror
to
find
out
why
the
ground
you
walk
on
is
cursed
.

If
right
and
wrong
actually
exist
,
then
it
's
wrong
.

Now
,
as
for
the
psalms
,
and
other
enlightening
anecdotes
,
I
dig
them
,
baby
,
wholeheartedly
,
so
long
as
everybody
's
embraced
it
completely
.

Judging
by
the
exchange
of
letters
released
to
the
public
,
relations
between
the
Senate
and
House
budget
conferees
are
as
acrimonious
as
they
've
ever
been
.

We
get
what
we
deserve
.

The
Senate
gave
in
on
its
main
point
weeks
ago
and
if
we
reach
July
1
with
no
budget
,
it
is
on
the
House
's
head
.

no
one
to
fix
the
roads
or
finish
temporary
repairs
or
new
construction

On
the
actual
issue
of
how
much
tax
is
enough
-
I
find
myself
influenced
by
both
sides
'
arguments
to
a
certain
extent

I
went
to
DHRM
-LRB-
the
state
human
resources
dept
-RRB-
and
looked
at
the
open
jobs
,
to
see
what
the
state
does
.

Go
look
at
DHRM
and
the
state
courts
system
-LRB-
separate
HR
dept
-RRB-
and
see
what
the
state
folks
do
,
and
who
all
you
're
talking
about
furloughing
.

next
to
his
singular
guilelessness
and
candor
,
we
are
the
multitude
of
the
prevaricating
and
pusillanimous
.

The
little
mouse
that
Michael
was
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
rat
race
and
quickly
learned
to
hate
it
,

On
June
13
,
2005
,
the
courts
found
Michael
not
guilty
of
the
charges
brought
against
him
.

Unfortunate
for
the
unpaid
staff
and
the
abandoned
llamas
but
no
surprise
.

is

I

It
's
Saturday

,
and
the

say
a

then
I
see
the
new
R.I.
post
is
about
the
perrenial
child
Michael
Jackson

There
's
also
some
curious

Anonymous

``
Jackson

stay

was
arranged

David
Kuo

He
was
muscle
for
a
Pittsburgh
madam
named
Tex
Gill
.

Now
,
for
me
,
the
interesting
part
happened
years
later
.

I
remembered
something
about
him
being
linked
with
Victor
Bout
and
the
UAE
two
-
step
currently
going
on
:

It
's
very
effective
,
as
many
'
feel
'
that
whilst
MJ
is
naive
he
's
not
capable
of
the
evil
associated
with
pedophile
activity
.

Is
n't
Michael
Jackson
,
and
the
entire
Jackson
clan
,
Jehovah
's
Witness
?

maybe
we
remain
anonymous
in
preparation
for
the
future
.

Glad
someone
finally
mentioned
Janet
.

But
by
all
reliable
accounts
,
DeLay
became
a
much
nastier
,
a
fearsomely
<ENAMEX

S_OFF="3">un-Christian
individual
.

Was
n't
there
a
Michael
Jackson
video
where
he
was
envisioning
himself
as
ruler
of
the
world
or
some
such
?

When
peasant
workers
break
free
to
touch
Michael
,
they
are
immediately
swallowed
by
soldiers

I
'm
not

that

about
Singapore

but
,
as
someone
who
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
there
over
the
past
20
years
,
I
can
testify
that
traffic
in
the
center
city
is
much
improved
without
any
indication
that
economic
development
has
been
curtailed
.

think
about
the
same
model
with

and
electronic
tolling
.

If
you
want
to
continue
the

then
Maryland
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
propose
their
approach

management
using
Northern

as
a
competitive
alternative
to

Although
the

vaguely
stylish
,
inside

beyond
the

to
coprophilia
-RRB-
,
there
is
a
labyrinth
of
cubicles
,
private
rooms
and
viewing
areas
.

At
stake
,
it
was
further
argued
as
the
old
generation
of
whores
began
to
leave
the

in
droves
,
was
the
very
soul
of
Paris
itself
.

The
debates
around

are
still
,
surprisingly
,
very
much
a
live
issue
in

``

Ovidie
said
,

he
is

his

celebrate

condemns
it

Perhaps

``

Affordable
public
transportation
was
developed
to
ease
the
overcrowding
and
polllution
that
prevailed
before

But
Jim
,
is
it
a
victory
solely
if

are
n't
raised

If
I
wanted
to
run
for
office
in

,
I
'd
go
door
-
to

door
and
say
``
I
'm
running
because
Tim
Kaine
lied
to
us
about
development

Are
you
also
willing
to
also
reform
counterproductive
zoning
codes
that
requires
people
to
stay
in
the
business
of
farming
,
for
example
?

The
APF
idea
is
the
same
kind
of
joke
.

I
have
corrected
it
.

Bottom
line
is
we
need
more
capacity
and
land
use
reform
.

We
can
not
take
hard
lines
on
every
issue
and
make
progress
in
any
direction

The
only
thing
that
surprises
me
is
how

happening

Virginia
Centrist
,
To
add
insult
to
injury
,
the
rest
of
the
state
helped
pay
for
288
in
last
year
's
budget
deal
--
wiped
the
slate
clean
of
debt
.

Then
,
of
course
there
is
the
sunday
drive
,
the
trip
to
grandma
's
,
and
the
soccer
games
,
but
still
,
the
overwhelming
need
is
to
support
business
.

Reality
check
here
-

What
's
consistently
overlooked
in
the
debate
ovre
288
is
what
else
that
$
400
million
could
have
been
spent
on
.

how
were
those
parcels
assembled
?

At
best
,
if
NoSprawlTax
had
their
way
the
tax
collected
on
those
properties
would
fall
and
everyone
else
's
would
go
up
.

Schwartz
's
claim
that
the
new
roads
will
do
nothing
for
99
%
of
the
drivers
in

is
a
classic
bad
argument
.

We
should
be
working
to
give

tools
they
can
use

dispassionately
make

that
are

all

Right
after
she
buys
,
she
will
probably
join

I
have
a
good
friend
who
attended
a
meeting
in
Richmond
where
a
famous
developer
stood
up
and
told
the
crowd
that
he
built
things
and
its
was
the
taxpayers
'
job
to
pay
for
the
infrastructure
to
support
whatever
he
built
.

but
I
'm
not
so
sure
it
does
n't
make
some
sense
by
some
other
measure

On
the
day
the
American
tanks
rolled
into
Baghdad
,
Abather
Abdul
Hussein
and
his

Balqes

,
threw
flowers

Balqes
wanted
her
job
back

confirmed
Abather
's
story
in
emails
to
me
,
calling
him
and
Balqes
``
very
helpful
individuals
''
who
``
risked
their
lives
by
meeting
with
us
.
''
-RRB-

``
This
is
the
end

''
Abather
thought
,

it
would
rather
ignore
them
than
acknowledge
that
its
initiative
has
failed
.

But
when
he
returned
to
the
Jordanian
border
less
than
a
week
later
,
he
was
told
he
could
n't
reenter
the
country
:

then
they
put
him
on
the
floor
in
the
back
of
the
bmw
and
sped
off
.

To
get
past
the
compound
's
first
wall
,
we
navigated
a
metal
detector
,
a
body
frisk

and
an
X-ray

but
there
was
only
silence
as
the

welled
up

Some

never
go

I
'm

It
would
take
too
long
here

analyze

reasons

Scandal

a
potent
agent

exposing

religious
tyranny
--
in
sum
,
all
the
secret
and
odious
underpinnings
of
a
system
that
had
to
be
destroyed

Our
morality
may
have
been
more
demanding
and
more
dangerous
than
the
prevailing
order
,
but
it
was
also
stronger
,
richer
,
more
coherent
.

We
had
to
open
all
doors
to
the
irrational

keep
only
those
images
that
surprised
us

's
the

we

is
produced

he
answered
me
,
"

'll
discover
that

The

giant

has
become
a
frightened
mouse
thanks
to
the
Islamic
resistance

through

settlement
of

question
with
the
participation
of
Abu

entity
in

for
a
calendar

that
aim
ultimately
at
the
repression

If

This
is
the
ugliest
type

We
can
mention
some
of
them
in
brief
below
:

For
example
,
some
tribes
will
only
eat
after
the
guest
has
eaten
and
will
only
finish
after
he
finishes
,
even
if
he
stays
for
a
full
hour
.

Up
to
the
time
that
his
statement
was
released
,
he
was
working
to
create
a
rift
among
the
ranks
of
the
Kurdish
movement
and
disputes
between
them
,
implicating
the
Kurds
in
a
series
of
failed
armed
skirmishes
against
the
central
government
-LRB-
some
of
which
did
not
fail
to
serve
the
interests
of
foreign
forces
-RRB-
,
in
starting
a
destructive
Kurdish
civil
war
in
the
nineties
,
then
getting
involved
in
the
plan
to
invade
and
occupy
Iraq
,
which
has
brought
the
country
to
the
state
of
hell
,
destruction
and
death
it
finds
itself
in
.

Since
Israel
started
its
nuclear
program
in
the
sixties
with
French
assistance
,
it
has
been
shrouded
in
mystery
.

God
grant
us
success

I
do
not
know
anything
about
them

The
obvious
negativity
from
some
does
not
mean
that
you
will
not
face
negativity
in
life
,
in
the
community
.

I
mean
,
if
you
gave
that
sum
to
an
uneducated
Indian
caretaker
,
he
would
make
at
least
a
10
%
profit
from

The
past
six
years
have
seen
the
greatest
degree
of
military
escalation
and
political
aggravation
in
all
the
crises
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
neither
escalation
nor
aggravation
has
helped
achieve
the
specific
agendas
of
any
side
that
has
worked
to
provoke
or
inflame
these
crises

With
regard
to
kohl
and
its
effect
on
the
eyes

doctors
at

found
that
the
percentage
of

samples
of
kohl
of
the
kind
sold
at
perfumeries
and
available
in
shops
,
especially
Indian
brands
,
is
between
85
percent
and
100
percent
per

The

it

Is

a
reality

China
's
income
tax
can
not
become
a
tool
for
keeping
the
poor
perpetually
poor
;
it
can
not
become
a
social
tool
that
keeps
on
producing
a
penniless
proletariat
.

In
Chinese
society
,
20
%
of
the
people
hold
80
%
of
social
wealth
,
and
80
%
of
the
people
are
able
to
use
only
20
%
of
the
social
wealth
to
suffer
through
their
lives
.

In
Western
countries
,
the
personal
income
tax
is
the
most
effective
means
of
controlling
excessively
high
incomes
among
the

The

dragged

Three
stages
of
setting
up
a
business
from
scratch

The
Internet
is
absolutely
a
place
for
the
daring
to
be
forceful
.

Maybe
when
you
read
about
the
advantages
of
establishing

above
,
your
heart
was
racing
and
you
were
thinking

'd

make
it

I
think
that
the
Writers
'
Association
is
n't
any
kind
of
important
department
affecting
the
national
economy
and
people
's
livelihood
and
whether
it
was
the
lifelong

system
would
draw
nobody
's
attention
.

He
was
using
his
heart

in
his

in
this

that
is
already
not
very

.

Does
Zhang
Weiying
's
misinterpretation
of
revolution
harbor
malicious
intent
?

Revolution
is
clearly
a
thing
for
the
majority
,
for
the
masses
of
people
,
and
altruistic
;
therefore
revolution
is
good

righteous

China

China
is
fully
capable

withstanding
the
impacts
.

Long
-
term
export
of
Chinese
products
at
low
prices
will
lead
to
"
impoverished
wealth
growth
,
"
and
we
should
specially
understand
the
"
wealth
"
as
domestic
environmental
resources
.

However
,
after
2020
,
China
will
be
facing
the
puzzle
of
population
aging
,
which
is
sure
to
witness
an
economic
slowdown
.

Finally
somebody
introduced
me
to
one
;
we
made
a

for
the

to
go

also
meet

This
is
a
topic
that
I
have
spent
much
of
the
last
five
years
trying
to
get

to
be
concerned
about
.

Like
the

bubble
six
years

another
prime
-
assets
bubble
burst
in
2006
;
this
time
it
was
the
huge
U.S.
real
estate
bubble
.

Even
though
I
do
not
believe
the
global
economy
is
in
for
a
hard
landing
,
if
global
growth
slips
one
percentage
point
below
the
average
of
49
%
for
the
last
four
years
,
I
will
not
think
it
unexpected
.

Many
shoes
now
use
a
fixed
frame
;
the
fixed
frame
is
a
polymer
part
that
is
used
as
support
and
is
distributed
longitudinally
around
the
outside
of
the
shoe
.

At
the
same
time
,
when
you
buy
shoes
they
should
not
be
too
tight
;
there
should
be
a
space
as
wide
as
a
thumbnail
between
the
tip
of
the
shoe
and
your
longest
toe
to
ensure
that
your
toes
can
move
freely
,
and
it
should
fit
properly
at
the
heel

Guo
Kai
's
Economics
Notes

Private
institutions
spend
their
own
money
,
and
too
much
expansion
will
make
them
suffer
loss
.

My
mother
was
a
peasant
and
my
father
was
a
carpenter
;
they
were
both
typical
,
solid
country
folk
.

I
think
being
a
good
person
is
the
first
reason
I
am
able
to
make
money
.

Regarding
everyone
's
suggestions
:

Read
what
those
who
are
really
successful
have
written
;
articles
like
this
are
hard
to
come
by
.

He
is
prohibited
by
statute
from
accepting
gifts
and
hospitality
valued
at
more
than
2.99
US
dollars
,

In
the
series
of
selling
off
,
state
assets
have
been
greatly
diminished
,
and
privileges
and
corrupt
elements
have
left
no
stone
unturned

To
friends
and
relatives
,
it
's
a
proud
thing
to
be
mentioned
.

Since
I
became
a
coach
,
I
have
had
little
time
to
take
on
the
court
and
play
a
match
with
team
members
because
once
the
coaches
step
onto
the
court
,
the
other
team
members
will
stop
to
watch
us
play
and
wo
n't
carry
out
their
training
duties
very
well
.

A
foreign
intelligence
agency
spokesperson
said
that
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
Russian
Intelligence
Agency
have
never
carried
out
any
assassination
activity
since
1959
.

In
New
Westminster
,
a
homicide
occurred
yesterday
in
an
apartment
where
many
Chinese
reside
,

Their
direction
is
specific
and
definite
.

Iraqi
officials
said
at
least
138
people
were
killed
;
but
some
reports
noted
that
the
death
toll
was
over
140
.

What
was
Saddam
prosecuted
for
?

Its
position
is
even
higher
than
that
of
Harvard
in
the
US
.

Where
can
they
go
to
get
the
money
?

Overseas
,
such
as
in
the
US
,
this
is
n't
possible
at
all
.

In
a
flash
,
I
was
twelve
and
attending
a
local
middle
school
that
had
a
bad
reputation
.

Even
though
he
has
n't
been
selected
as
an
academician
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
,
and
has
n't
won
a
Nobel
Prize
,
none
of
this
can
disguise
the
holy
brilliance
that
he
personally
possesses
.

"
We
are
all

What
about
?

Mao
Zedong
led
the
Chinese
people
through
decades
of
bloodshed
and
hard
struggle
.

I
have
n't
written
about
soccer
for
a
long
time
.

France
and
Rwanda
have
fallen
out
with
each
other
.

When
they
have
friends
,
they
wo
n't
be
so
easily
bullied
.

I
could
n't
argue
with
that
,
as
English
is
my
weakness
.

In
terms
of
its
historical
themes
,
it
diverges
too
much
from
real
history
.

According
to
statistics
,
of
the
shocking
amount
of
the
world
's
electronic
trash
,
80
%
are
shipped
to
Asia
,
and
among
them
90
%
are
discarded
in
China
.

I
've
heard
some
of
their
songs
,
and
I
do
n't
like
them
much
,
for
example
,
that
very
famous
song
,
"
How
Can
It
Be
This
Way
.
"

Qingqing
got
up
and
put
on
clothes
by
himself
,
and
then
went
to
the
kindergarten
with
Grandma
,

Qingqing
did
not
agree
:
"
That
's
my
home
.

The
snow
-
white
and
fragrant
jasmine
flowers
that
grew
out
of

First
,

if
the

has
"
business
intuition
.
"

Internazionale
Milan
has
lost
the
previous
two
matches
to
the
opponents
,
but
now
they
have
finally
began
to
explode
;
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
such
an
explosion
would
be
too
late
.

Today
,
Singapore
's
Zaobao.com
reporter
Yu
Zeyuan
filed
a
report
from
Beijing
--
"
Chinese
Official
Media
Silent
on
28th
Anniversary
of
Mao
Zedong
's
Death
"
,

So
people
are
not
allowed
to
approach
and
cross
the
border
at
the
edge
of
Lake
Tianchi
.

I
think
on
the
contrary
that
it
's
not
whether
Mao
Zedong
has
been
"
forgotten
even
by
the
common
people
"
,
but
rather
that
certain
people
and
certain
powers
are
too
anxious
and
too
impatient
.

These
achievements
simply
are
n't
worth
mentioning
when
compared
with
those
of
powerhouses
such
as
Manchester
United
and
Real
Madrid
.

Why
?

I
had
already
lost
one
part
-
time
job
,
I
could
not
lose
the
second
one
.

A
few
days
ago
when
he
had
not
yet
found
a
place
to
live
,
Li
Yan
had
been
worried
about
his
meals
,
but
now
the
issue
of
meals
has
been
smoothly
resolved
.

A
large
man
holding
a
machine
gun
from
a
distance
runs
to
a
doorway
of
the
home
of
a
small
man
,
then
sees
that
the
small
man
is
holding
a
vegetable
knife
with
which
he
is
about
to
slice
vegetables
.

After
reforms
here
and
reforms
there
,
the
outcome
was
that
wealth
had
fled
into
the
hands
of
the
"
elite
"
and
the
foreigners
.

A
mother
has
to
go
through
various
kinds
of
pregnancy
-
related
discomfort
during

,

One
of
the
documents
entitled
"
A
contingency
plan
for
Brazil
"
was
drafted
with
the
help
of
the
then
US
Ambassador
in
Brazil
Gordon
.

Later
on
,
we
were
compelled
by
pressure
to
renew
the
free
distribution
of
the
Chinese
language
packs
.

The
government
has
introduced
legislation
that
will
permit
further
collection
of
DNA
samples
from
people
's
bodies
.

This
element
is
the
constitution
which
regulates
the
course
of
the
country
and
the
rights
of
the
ruler
and
the
ruled
at
various
levels
.

It
does
not
include
any
views
of
the
other
Sunni
sects
and
the
Shiites
in
the
textbooks
.

So
far
the
number
of
those
who
read
this
article
has
exceeded
1600
people
.

It
is
very
easy
for
us
to
use
Islam
,
but
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
serve
Islam
.

and
the
lurkers
for

are
many
...

what
supports
the

that

I
really
see
destruction
and
evil
spreading
,
encompassing
Iraq
.

In
a
press
interview
conducted
with
him
immediately
after
the
ratification
,
he
expressed
the
wish
that
his
tenure
would
end
soon
and
that
he
would
not
accept
renewal
.

May
God
grant
us
and
you
success
,
and
may
He
give
our
eyes
and
your
eyes
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
death

destruction
of
the

into

was

I
sat
imagining

in

I
have

with

The
most
important
thing
for
him
is
to
become
famous

even
at
the
expense
of
his
honor
,
if
he
has
any

If
you
were
saved
from

,
as
soon
as
he

the

call
from

the

took
me
out

felt
confident

refused
the
request
to
impound
the
car
of
the
reporter
to
confirm
the
truth
about
its

and
where
exactly
it
was
,
especially
since
the
documents
of
the
proceedings
are
devoid
of
anything
that
proves
that
or
proves
that
there
was
an
accident
,
as
the
reporter
alleged
.

Incompetence
during
the
period
of
the
experience

We
said
:
-LRB-
You
have
the
decision
of
the

.

He
refused
to
give
us
its
number
or
its
date
,
and
he
kept
the
issue
a
secret
while
he
was
promising
it
to
us
.

Or
is
it
an
actual
picture
in
the
country
of
monotheism
and
justice
?

What
should
be
mentioned
are
the
good
deeds
of

The

I
swear
by
God
if
any
of
these
traitors
had
been
in
Saddam
Hussein
's
place
you
would
have
seen
him
weeping
,
begging
or
at
least
fainting
more
than
once
.

Praise
be
to
God
that
the
way
of
executing
Saddam
Hussein
was
the
most
clear
message
to
all
Arab
leaders
and
peoples
that
the
Rafida
and
sons
of
temporary

are
evil
and
danger
has
come

Peres
says
:
All

Want
Hamas
.

In
other
words
,
the
man
is
looking
for
more
peace
than
war
.

His
Highness
the
Prince
receives
the
man
of
peace
in
Israel
in
an
attempt
to
bring
Hamas
and
Israel
together
.

He
said
that
he
considered
the
statement
of
former
American
President
Jimmy
Carter
about
Israel
's
oppression
of
the
Palestinians
a
grave
mistake
,
and
he
stressed
that
Carter
should
retract
these
opinions
.

But
the
question
now
is
:
Who
is
better
..
Peres
or
George
Bush
?

First
-
lack
of
vision
:

But

used

The
Angry
North

If
this
climate
was
impossible
in
the
light
of
the
Occupation
and
the
savage
terrorism
circumstances
and
in
the
light
of
the
lack
of
the
state
's
sovereignty
,
it
would
be
wiser
to
postpone
the
issuing
of
a
new
bill
incompatible
with
the
precepts
of
the
national
oil
policy
,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
half
a
century
,
until
a
time
when
conditions
are
suitable
for
a
serious
debate
and
for
a
wide
-
scale
public
participation
in
the
formulation
of
any
serious
decision
to
be
taken
in
this
sphere
.

Technology
does
not
develop
in
isolation
from
the
ability
to
make
decisions
and
in
isolation
from
its
relation
with
society
and
its
institutions
.

Seventh
:
discussions
are
to
be
held
about
the
cash
distribution
of
part
of
the
oil
revenue
,

I
remember
that
few
years
ago
the
national
team
of
Saudi
Arabia
was
participating
in
an
Asian
championship
held
in
an
East
-
Asian
country
--
I
think
it
was
Thailand
!

The
truth
is
that
most
of
the
newspapers
stopped
saying
that
the
girls
supporting
the
Saudi
team
are
Saudis
,
since
the
features
and
complexions
of
those
girls
are
not
in
keeping
with
the
Saudi
climate
!?

But
what
is
disgraceful
and
shameful
is
to
welcome
such
dishonorable
sights
,
shameful
clothes
,
unrestrained
hair
,
and
swaying
,
while
we
see
girls
from
the
UAE
and
Kuwait
in
the
grandstand
of
their
teams
looking
respectable
and
modest
,
with
some
of
them
covering
their
faces
!

It
is
wrong
to
turn
our
disability
into
a
general
impossibility
,
to
be
a
reason
for
holding
others
back
,
and
to
smother
their
abilities
and
capabilities
.

It
was
something
done
by
those
who
wanted
to
do
it
.

Thank
you
for
your
good
thoughts
about
me
.

Our
society
is
more
honorable
and
nobler
than
a
nobody
like
you
talking
about
it
and
describing
it
using
the
worst
adjectives
as
if
you
are
talking
about
the
societies
of
the
West
.

When
he
became
impolite
,
he
was
halted
in
the
most
polite
and
reasonable
way
.

Has
anyone
seen
a
singer
or
an
actress
with
such
shamelessness
?..

My
brother
,
get
acquainted
with
a
prince
or
ask
Aba
Lujayn
to
introduce
you
to
one
of
his
friends
the
thieves
..
so
you
and
him
along
with
the
gang
of
merry
-
making
can
become
like
the
economic
analysts
who
are
paid
for
what
they
say
on
the
satellites
to
deceive
the
common
people
so
that
their
masters
and
the
providers
of
their
livelihood
may
profit
......................

And
the
funny
thing
is
that
some
of
them
tied
the
kaffiyeh
on
their
heads
!

Because
she
tied
the
kaffiyeh
on
her
head
the
way
the
people
of
Yemen
do
,
I
said
what
I
did
in
sarcasm
,
not
to
attack
the
women
of
Yemen
!

Saddam
Hussein
-LRB-
mockingly
-RRB-
:
I
thought
you
had
come
to
apologize
and
restore
power
to
the
Iraqis
.

You
are
the
ones
who
have
opened
the
floodgates
to
cascades
of
blood
on
the
soil
of
Iraq
,
you
plotted
against
us
and
got
some
traitors
to
take
over
power
over
the
land
of
the
great
Iraq
.

Saddam
Hussein
:
Have
you
obtained
the
consent
of
your
president
to
this
offer
?

Do
you
remember
your
offers
?

You
have
previously
made
me
an
offered
before
this
through
your
men
that
I
say
the
weapons
of
mass
destruction
were
smuggled
to
Syria
,
and
you
said
that
the
price
was
my
release
.

Saddam
Hussein
:
On
the
contrary
,
history
will
judge
you
because
of
your
crimes
..

May

This
is
what
leads
us
to
be
sure
that
everything
has
negative
aspects
just
as
it
has
positive
aspects
,
like
medicines
which
cure
a
disease
but
while
doing
so
cause
another
disease
,
and
similar
repercussions
which
sometimes
lead
to
destruction
.

The
Saudi
family
under
the
leadership
of
our
wise
government
has
every
right
to
monitor
,
hold
to
account
,
and
control
the
implementation
of
projects
.

In
conclusion
:
It
is
now
time
to
sit
together
at
the
table
of
the
country
.

Thank
you
for
passing
by
.

The
new
regulations
it
had
endorsed
maintained
the
market
's
balance
.

or
will
the
Authority
prove
its
failure
and
confirm
that
it
is
only
a
scarecrow
solely
against
the
poor
and
the
weak
.

They
will
give
him
a
call
and
stop
him
;
the
Authority
knows
its
limits
well
.

The
total
costs
of
the
Jeddah
project
is
expected
to
amount
to
approximately
50
billion
riyals
and
will
turn
the
map
of
the
town
upside
down
.

He
explained
that
the
Saudi
authorities
were
insistent
on
driving
out
the
speculators
who
were
pushing
the
market
into
harming
them
and
the
small
investors
.

He
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
study
on
dividing
the
market
because
it
was
difficult
to
place
profitable
,
strong
companies
alongside
weak
loss
-
making
ones
,
and
this
is
where
the
Capital
Market
Authority
plays
a
role
.

through
the
increase
of
investment
in
the
Samba
Financial
Group
to
make
its
share
larger
than
5
percent
;
the
industrial
sector
through
the
increase
in
investment
in
the
National
Industrialization
Company
to
increase
the
share
of
the
Kingdom
Holding
Company
to
more
than
10
percent
;
and
the
food
production
sector
through
the
increase
in
investment
in
the
Safola
Company
to
make
its
share
larger
than
13
percent
;
and
the
media
sector
through
a
new
investment
in
the
Saudi
Research
and
Publishing
company
of
a
more
than
25
percent
share
in
the
company
,
in
addition
to
the
investment
in
a
number
of
companies
that
will
soon
be
publicly
listed
on
the
Saudi
stock
market
,
such
as
the
Mid
Gulf
company
in
the
insurance
sector
.

And
"
more
importantly
,
the
investor
must
be
educated
to
invest
in
companies
that
have
a
good
future
.

This
might
be
totally
true
,

But
now
,
this
victory
has
totally
evaporated
in
the
Arab
street
,
thanks
to
the
stupidity
of
those
who
ordered
the
execution
of
Saddam
Hussein
and
the
dance
over
his
body
.

Here
is
what
the
Sheikh
said
as
quoted
from
his
website
Islam
Today
:
--

But
we
have
to
contemplate
the
way
in
which
he
was
tried
and
the
mechanism
for
carrying
out
the
sentence
and
the
interfering
and
controlling
Rafida
hand
in
this
aspect
so
that
he
was
only
tried
for
his
case
against
the
Shia
.

Do
you
mean
the
profits
and
losses
on
the
balance
sheets
of
this
world
or
the
balance
sheets
of
the
next
?

There
is
no
God
but
God
.

I

may

may

were

by
the

bottles
flying
in

sky
and
falling
over
nearby
houses
,
which
led
to
fires
and
cracks
in
the
houses
from
the
power
of
the
explosion
.

They
stayed
asleep
until
the
morning
,
4
or
5
hours
after
the
explosions
,
fires
,
and
the
disaster
ended

%uh

it
was
amazing

good
luck

right

It
's
crazy

at
that
the
other
I
mean
at
that
price
level
I
could
pay
more
probably
%mm
which
maybe
I
'll
look
it

probably

I
taught
,
okay
.
I
taught
I
taught
business
English
.

and
we
had
to
jump
in
this
water

%um

And
it
was

and
she
's
got
her
%um
she
's
healthy
again
.

It
was
done
as
an
example
of
what
we
do
.

yeah
.

But
it
was
kind
of
hellish
for
a
bit
.

She
what
?

And
%um
I
do
n't
know

yeah

.

What
?

I
mean
if
i-
,
if
it
's
June
then
that
,
that
would
be
fine
.

Be
kind
of
fun
.

It
's
because
of
bad
administrative
things

yeah

yeah

It
's
called
total
phone
.

We-
,

uh-huh
.

yeah
,
it
's

uh-huh
.

I
I
'm
not
,

You
ca
n't
do
that
in
an
American
classroom
.

and
%uh
Hiroki
has
appointed
himself
as
her
protector

I
do
n't
know
at
what
point
I
will
call
up
his
cousin
,

it
's
%eh
it
's
awful

so
oh
very
good
yeah
that
's
a
good
idea
My
summer
vacation
starts
now

it
's
not
%uh
politics
though

oh
jeez
I
did
n't
know

no
no

Hello

Well

on
grants

but
they
do
n't
believe
that
so
many
people
die
in
the
United
States
because
it
's
so
wonderful

oh
she
misses
right
now
%eh
%eh
for
Rosh
Hashanah

you
see
him

%uh
they
're
just
names
to
me
really

yeah

%um

they
could
n't
go
anywhere
do
anything

could
b-

and
it
was
so
successful
they
named
it
after
him
now

and
Gloria
and
Bessie
Kocherstein
I
remember

right

yeah

I

I
remember

yeah

No
no

he
'll
never
remember
.

Wow

I
do
n't
have
a
lot
of
things

yeah

so
I
feel
just
fine
.

And
what
's
the
baby
's
name
?

that
's

and
I
and
i-
I
mean
it
does
make
a
lot
of
intellectual
sense
,
I
guess
.

%hm
so
they
're
living
with
him
?

and
then
you
know
he
never
said
a
thing
about
it
.

his
opinion
on
it
has
had
changed
,

or
are
you
teaching
?

I
really
I
mean
I
was
n't
really
paying
that
much
attention
to
what
he
said

How
you
doing
?

I
stole
a
few

yeah

yeah

oh
yes

So
it
's
not
like
you
know

uh-huh

yeah

okay

To
prevent
?

Right

uh-huh

yeah

%uh
no

I
have
n't
see
her
kids
in
over
a
year
.

oh
yeah

uh-uh

whatever

it
's
not

I
got
one
nice
one

What

They
're
studying
l-

oh
goo-

A
long
a
long
term
%uh
next
generation
%uh
fighter
plane
.

they
just
get
rid
of
what
they
do
n't
want
.

They
're
going
to
make
you
pay
everything
.

And
there
's
not
necessarily
any
benefit
to
it
either
.

No
about
four
about
five
times
that
.

That
's
why
I
I
got
the
I
remember
I
got
th-
the
first
paycheck

It
's
great
.

and
he
's
active
.

yeah

I
would
n't
sa-
a-
%uh
ren-

yeah
.

It
little
Liz
has
her
own
reasons
for
you
know
being
in
America
.

mhm
.

I
'm
--
uh-huh
.
--
active
with
a
state
group
that
's
trying
to
work
for
a
universal
single
pair
health
plan
mhm
--
on
a
state
level

so
now
for
the
eightieth
--
--
they
want
me
to
do
it
a
little
differently
this
time

but
%mm
you
know
it
started
in
Ann
Arbor
.

mhm
.

I

mhm
.

she

yeah

Sure

Either

%eh
it
just
registered
.

it
's
been
about
a
year
.

I
think
I
'm
not
sure
whether
Linda
g-
that

uh-huh
.

once
a
year
.

you
're
wonderf-

he
sells
sandals
and
and
stuff
like
that

It
does

which
one
did
I
send
you

and
%um
and
you
know
it
's
got
our
beds
and
the
bathroom
and
stuff

Hebrew
University
is
just
right
above
us

Well
I
thought

At
what
ti-

What
does
that
stand
for

he
's
really
really
good
really
good
teacher
%um

and
he
was
saying
%um
somebody
asked
him

I
mean
they
're
just
they
're
very
you
know

Right
.

mhm
%hm

Right
.

You
know
it
just
%uh
depends
on
if
you
would
just
like
the
you
know
stand
by

%uh
,
well
I
mean
that
's
some-
Can
we
do
that
?
%mm
that
's
something
you
could
do
.

If
you
can
change
it
.

It
is
true
.

Who
,
where
did
it
come
from
?
458.93_461.27_A:

okay
.

That
's
groovy
.

No
.

oh
sure
.

uh-huh
.

yeah
.

Yes
,

But
I
have
to
make
up
my
mind
here
by
Friday
because
that
's
when
I
can
hold
my
ticket
too
.

No
it
's
north
of
Rathingen
,

It
's
a
fancy
wedding
too
.

So
this
is
a
real
mhm
.
German
wedding
.

But
I
thought
you
playing
piano
you
must
have
that
.

But
so
if
you
want
to
bow
out
.

oh
no
,
no
,
no
,
no
.

And
the
and
the
way
he
was
talking
,
I
guess
he
's
it
sounds
like
his
wife
's
family
is
well
-
to
-
do
or
something
.

Like
we
could
see
each
other
.

uh-huh
.

I
mean
,
i-
it
's
of
cour-
,
it
's
a
change
,

Because
this
woman
had
such
a
that
people
react
to
you
as
a
reflection
of
you
.

and
I
ignore
the
fact
that
she
's
crying
.

and
it
was
raining

easier
for
us
.

yeah
,

and
it
's
no
they
want
to
really
publish
it
.

yeah
.

I
'm
so
happy
that
I
have
email
.

well
I
was
supposed
to
go
back
today

%hm

Especially
from
that
weekend
like
up
on
the
fucking
mountain
in
the
rain
.

uh-huh

So
she
called
back
at
noon
.

and
I
've
already
go-
I
'm
already
up
to
my
eyeballs
in
work

She
was
talking
about
the
origins
of
language

I
thought
like
this
semester
would
be
like
better
for
you
.

and
%um
then
like
of
you
want
to
go
outside
the
border
then
you
can
like
pay
up
to
the
border

But
did
I
tell
you
this
?

You
sound
really
far
away
.

it
's
kind
of

It
,
I
like
what
I
'm
doing

and
,
I
mean
once
they
make
friends
with
you
,
then
they
're
nice
to
you
.

I
mean
,
I
must
have
ten
times
more
gray
hair
than
nine
months
ago
.

So
,
%eh
the
other
day
I
took
a
bus
trip
up
to
the
high-
into
the
highlands

And
the
wind
blows
me
into
the
hedge
.
You
know
?

You
can
go
in
down
there
.

Really
?

yeah
,

O

uh-huh

well
you
you
do
it
by
paragraph
.

and
she
--
Wonderful
.
--
yeah
,
she
spoke
to
them

--
she
's
really
remarkable
.

in
fact
in
October
she
's
going
to
another
one
convention
in
Buffalo
.

%ah

I
ca
n't
begin
to
tell
you
.

It
is
so
--
--
unbelievably
sad
.

but
the
%uh

I
I
'm
just
worried
how
long
this
can
go
on
.
Because
,
you
see
,
Rabin
is
having
a
hell
of
a
time
to
satisfy
the
elements
.
You
know
.

But
you
see

You
never
know
,

And
one
day
the
people
will
d-
will
have
enough
of
it
.

And
it
's
only
the
Swiss
who
got
my
two
suitcases
together
.

yeah
I
--
You
nee-
you
nee-
--
should
have
done
it
.

That
's
what
I
should
have
done
.

you
know
Ida
I
've
had
this
terrib-

The
do-
the
doctor
gave
it
to
me
.

Yes
.

Yes
.

it
's
about
the
well
it
's
pretty
much
the
same
as
as
what
I
'm
getting
you
know
but
%um
depending
upon
where
you
work
and
all

I
got
about
like
six
or
seven
years

%mm

but
%um
that
sort
of
ties
us
up
here
although
we
like
the
place

you
talked
to
people
you
know

yeah

because
even
like
you
know
I
mean
all
that
stuff
right
is
is
all
so
subject
to
whatever
change
in
the
weather
that
happens
to
be
right
?

I
mean
miss
like
you
know
the
smell
of
the
goddamn
onions
frying
in
the
pan
yeah
.
yeah
yeah
.
you
know
and
e-
each
little

it
I
you
know
I
realize
what
a
minute
okay

%um

yeah
yeah

she
's
coming
on
Friday
to
live

%um
%huh

it
's
really
nice

so

The
supper
is
ready
.

And
I
thought
well
this
is
true
,
cause
Martha
you
and
I
have
been
in
pretty
good
touch
since
April
,
and
you
never
mentioned
it
.

yeah
.

yeah
.

yeah
.

But

well
they
think
that
this
cancer
developed
from
the
the
bug
spray
and
the
weed
killer
that
they
put
on
the
the
grass
.

You
see
the
Auschwitz
pictures
,

yeah
,

But
%uh
You
know
I
y-
I
knew
when
the
list
came
out

oh
.

oh
really
?

uh-huh

%huh
?

You
know
what
I
mean
?

yeah
.

%um
,
and
so
I
think
that
's
better
actually
,

well
I
told
him
I
would
get
back
to
him
.

and
you
have
to
take
several
shots
of
each
grouping

%mm

Is
n't
it
it
's
right
next
door
,
right

at
the
Holiday
Inn
is
actually
the
same
price
.

and
so
you
know
,
it
's
a
,
it
's
a
it

The
Reserve

oh
,
you
mean
the
person
Charlie
works
for
?

and
it
's
just
packed
,
you
know
,
with
tourists
yes
whatever
,
and
lots
of
Italians

yeah

that
's
what
I
thought

the
preceding
Monday

that
,
that
kind
of
annoys
me

It
's
e-
what
I
'm
sort
of
kind
of
figuring
out
now
after
a
while
.

You
know
,
let
's
you
know
,
go
out
to
a
movie
and
so
forth
.

I
know
,

yeah

and
I
just

I
I
mean

so
I
just
,
I
was
a
little
bit
,
%um
a
little
bit
put
off
by
it
.
yeah
.
You
know
.

but
still
,

And
so
,
and
so
It
's
fine
with
me

well
,
okay
.

and
there
's
a
difference
between
ownership
,
I
think
.

And
as
soon
as
as
soon
as
I
move
back
here
,
he
's
out
.

You
know
what
I
'm
saying
.

I
do
n't
want
to
feel
restrained
because
it
'll
frustrate
me
uh-huh
.
and
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
concentrate
.

But
you
'll
be
over
here
packing
at
that
time
,
partially
.

uh-huh

oh
,
really
?

oh
yeah
?

yeah
,

yeah

I
did
the
filming
on
,
last
Thursday
.

no
.

and
they
're
paying
me

well
,
was
it
like
a
Helsinki
station
or
?

it
was
unbelievable

wow
.

so
what
's
what
's
the
deal
?

okay
,

Hawthorn
Drive
,

oh
that
's
good
.

it
's

oh

hey
that
's
great
.

is
that
it
?

Valerie
came
home

I
guess
they
do

I
've
never
seen
any
.

Yes

I
love
the
workshops

it
was
fun
.

I
'm
glad
she
could
because
just
it
happened
to
work
out
because
she
had
three
days
left
of
vacation
and
it
was
three
days

oh
no

see
I
did
n't
you
know

they
're
coming
up
a
little
bit
you
know

question

but
I
'm
thinking
why
does
n't
he
hold
off
another
week
aw
aye
you
know

Yes

Now
after
mass
Friday
morning
,
Dorothy
says
to
me
,
how
packed
are
you
?

So
we
'll
see
how
it
goes

but
he
's
really
basically

I
worked
with
him
this
whole
week

well
I
'll
tell
you
the
truth

She
married
that
guy

Well
I
guess
they
did
n't
have
a
choice

right

but
she
's
going
to
study
in
September

No

yeah

No

So
we
bought
all
different
shapes
and
sizes

and
on
the
grass
was
where
we
sat

just
you
did
n't
they
did
n't
dance

wow

and
you
were
entertaining
offers
.

yeah
.

And
%uh
,
I
turned
in
my
Master
's
thesis
back
in
May
,

If
you
look
,
i-
if
you
separate
out
the
different
modes
of
the
laser
mhm
.
and
look
at
one
of
those
,
you
get
more
than
one
frequency
.

oh
wow
.

and
yeah
.
%uh
,
i-
it
's
the
fact
that
I
would
be
writing
a
letter
that
is
the
impressive
part
of
it
all
.

So
are
you
still
living
in
that
house
in
the
middle
of
the
park
.

as
a
.

But
,
that
's
dealt
with
at
least
.

It
will
be
three
weeks
Tuesday
That
I
started
work

They
left
for
their
new
homes
on
Thursday

So

and
then
then
I
go
to
,
then
I
do
my
Detroit
area
visit
,

And
I
have
n't
been
to
Texas
in
a
while

I
I
do
n't
know
him
very
well

I
do
n't
know
.

Right

and
I
thought
oh
God
what
am
I
doing
you
know

I
keep
wondering
how
long
that
's
going
to
last
.

and
Kate
Katie
and
I
,
my
housemate
from
Oregon
went
together

I
do
n't

and
I
mean
in
some
ways
Joe
is
somebody
I
've
known
a
long
time
and
and
know
pretty
well

but
I
mean
we
're
both
sort
of
like
we
do
n't
know
where
life
is
taking
us

but
so
probably
you
know
but
you
know
I
'm
not
te-
I
'm
only
teaching
I
think
one
class

yeah

yeah

So
he
can
take
me
and
the
baby
up

That
's
a
good
point
.

Obvious
.

Why
?

uh-huh
.

and
then
Joel
showed
up

but
they
have
no
ability
to
set
any
limits
you
know
.

And
we
went
to
a
different
restaurant
a
cheap
restaurant

We
finally
made
him
take
them
out
for
an
afternoon
.

they
're
taking
Emma
on
a
they
're
on
a
camping
trip
right
now
with
the
baby
.

yeah
.

%um
.

So
I
mean
I
've
worked
the
past
two
weeks
.

So
,
I
have
none
left
whatsoever
.

but
I
just
ca
n't
wait
to
get
back
to
work

mhm
.

yeah
.

so
that
should
mean
something

so
he
took
%um
English
Comp
which
he
got
a
an
A
minus
in
I
believe
because
he
really
he
's
a
really
good
writer
.

At
the
last
four
which
were
right
which
he
would
have
had
credit
for
were
wrong
because
he
put
them
on
the
wrong
space
.

I
liked
it

oh
.

It
was
really
it
was
really
well
-
done

You
going
to
take
anymore
classes
after
this
?

uh-huh
.

I
just
do
n't
feel
comfortable
with
it
like
with
the
people
that
are
in
there

oh
I
hope
I
'm
not
being
prejudice

like
I
wa-
I
was
more
interested
in
watching
people
around
me
mhm
.
like
see
if
they
really
kind
of
like
really
got
into
it

I
got

in
the
world

Carmen
Sandiego

're
going
to
be
like

and
he
's
like

first
priority

if
I
called
you

so
hard

do
n't

it
's
like
scaring
me
,
hum

sound
like

yeah
.

.

and
I
kind
of
hinted
to
her
that
really
the
only
way
to
lose
weight
is
cardio
vascular
.
mhm
.
It
's
true
.
And
that
lifting
the
weights
wo
n't
lose
weight
.

yeah
.

yeah
.

uh-huh

so

See
,
that
way
I
can
have
exactly
what
I
want
.

No
.

Let
me
give
you
Kate
's
phone
number
.

and
Adele
still
talks
about
the
black
dress
.

Right
.

White
lillies
and
black
dresses
.

yeah
.

Are
you
talking
to
me
?

uh-huh
.

I
know
.

and
then
of
course
I
have
my
regular
Borghausen
thing
you
know
over
there
where
they
have
the
jazz
festival
yeah
?
on
the
Austrian
border

but
I
'm
going
to
try
,

%huh

oh
well

yeah

yeah

%eh
Lydia
Van
Damme
.

%eh
yeah

so
it
's
been
a
huge
success

the
no-

Well
%eh

He
went
on
tour
with
an
allstar
band
of
these
young
new
upcoming
players

did
he
say
anything
about
coming
here
?

--
and
I
send
them
a
cassette
so
that
when
they
get
here
you
know

And
I
'll
be
sending
him
of
course
eventually
%uh
soon
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
it
to
the
last
minute
the
titles
he
'll
play
on
the
cassette
and
the
chords
for
all
the
solos

he
's
been
quite
busy
and
yeah
.
playing
great

so
so
we
hopped
in
the
car
and
drove
down
to
be
there
mhm
.
%mm
mhm
.
for
the
day
.

and
%um
She
was
great
.

Reassuring
in
a
way
I
would
think
.

uh-huh
.

Her
mom
came
running
out
to
tell
us
the
baby
was
born
.

no

uh-huh
.

uh-huh
.

Who
have
like
these
big
broad
forearms
.

uh-huh
.

And
she
just
screamed
and
screamed
and
screamed
and
screamed
and
screamed

they
they
gave
us

they
could
n't
get
their
minds
around
the
notion
of
a
fifth
bracelet
for
us
.

but
he
was
a
fucker
.

How
old
was
he
?

And
I
want
to
,

Is
it

oh
how
neat

It
's
very
popular
in
Spain

uh-huh
.

I
think
she
's
great
.

I
did
n't
know
.

so
I
will
have
slept
on
the
plane
.

You
'll
be
back
here
by
the
time
he
gets
there
.

437.08_438.30_B:
it
's
not
a
mountain
bike
.

And
they
said
**ouchies**
?

And
wh-
my
other
thing
to
tell
you
,
what
?

So
I
went
to
the
doctor
.

but
%um
,
I
could
n't
get
a
or
two
in
.

So
,
you
know
,
I
'm
kind
of
not
looking
forward
to
that
,
or
anything
.

You
have
n't
gone
?

So
do
I
skip
school
?

That
'll
be
Monday
.

aw
.

that
would
be
okay

good
whew
.

There
was
something
that
was
really
funny
.

I
fixed
it
all
so
it
short
like
the
email
kind
of
copy
short
,
you
know
.

I
do
n't
really
see
where

%hm
are
you
having
fun
?

I
ca
n't
get
a
continuing
flight
to
Buffalo
until
five
in
the
evening
.

oh
wait
,

yeah

Because
he
's
getting
I
me-
he
's
got
off
from
the
twenty
-
eighth

So
I
do
n't
know
whether
we
'll
drive
down
the
thirty
-
first
or
the
first
or
if
whether
I
do
n't
know
exactly
whether
he
's
going
to
do
it
in
you
know
one
day
or
two
days
.

Who
else
but
cousins
are
coming
,

Because
I
know
she
was
in
touch
with
since
Dmitri
's
been
in
that
area
.

I
really
li-
I
was
really
impressed
with
her
when
we
visited
there
two
years
ago
.

I
says
I
'm
not
looking
at
your
private
messages
,
Reuven

I
have
to
remember
it
.

V
S
is
Victor
+Schoema+
,
I
guess
right

C
like
cat
.

U
M

mhm
.

uh-huh
.

yeah
?

and
it
's
just
totally
different
than
what
we
had
talked
about
.

mhm
.

Because
I
'm
thinking
that
I
'd
like
to
stop
in
Europe
on
the
way
and
visit
some
friends
.

and

Then
good
then
.

yeah
.

Ai
n't
worried
about
it
.

No
.

She
going
to
be
like
Jill
and
become
a
product
of
the
state
and
shit
live
off
welfare
and
god
damn
.

Anyway
so
I
spouted
my
mouth
off

So
I
think
,
I
think
I
did
that
on
purpose
.

She
%uh
she
did
n't
like
the
last
two
conversations
that
she
had
with
you
.

yeah
.

and
I
said
because
I
do
n't
.

And
%um
I
said
so
you
're
going
to
punish
me
because
you
're
offended
that
I
do
n't
particularly
want
you
to
stay
here
in
my
home
.

and

I
was
thinking
to
my-

she
sent
you
in

but
you
know
there
still
can
be
a
a
mutation

but
you
do
n't
you
do
n't
need
that

and
I
was
even
getting
mad

Well
when
I
get
back
you
know
I
mean
if
Tamara
washed
the
plates
that
's
very
nice

we
'll
wa-
we
wash
the
glasses

oh
Christian
's
really
looking
forward
to
coming
back
.

mhm

but
%um
god
when
I
come
back
to
Berlin
,
it
's
going
to
be
%um
it
's
going
to
it
's
going
to
be
like
You
know
stressed
from
day
one
because
%uh
yeah
because
the
show
the
show
is
coming
up
in
the
Vica

uh-huh

Did
I
tell
you
that
?

but
I
have
n't
had
you
know
any
good
response

what
what
she
doing
?

yeah

uh-huh
.

Well
if
I
'm
unemployed
,
if
I
'm
unemployed
I
ca
n't
be
a
yuppie
can
I
?

He
just
has
to
defend
.

yeah
.

And
they
do
n't
need
that
many
clothes
when
they
're
that
young
.

And
did
you
%um
Absolutely
.
Every
now
did
you
supplement
nursing
with
bottles
at
all
or
did
n't
,
did
n't
you
?

yeah
.

and
I
--
mhm
okay
.
--
threw
it
away

Well
we
never
go
out
.

you
know
at
first
you
feel
like
what
am
I
doing
putting
this
machine
on
me

yeah

It
's
like
once
I
started
at
at
work
I
you
know

Stopping
with
the
miscarriage
anxiety
starting
with
the
delivery
anxiety
.

oh
yeah

But
having
never
been
pregnant
before
,
you
know
I
'm
sure
Erica
has
like
no
idea

I
actually
did
start
drinking
more
milk

Liz
,
Liz
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
made
a
mistake
or
not
.

I
I
do
n't
know
yet
.

and
I
said
no
this
is
it
.

Certainly
April
not
not
not
earlier
.

It
's
very
sad
.

and
I
do
n't
think
that
you
would
Can
we
talk
about
the
job
things
now
?
that

I
want
to
fly
out
to
Michigan
and
visit
Matt
.

and
nobody
's
eating
it
.

I
'm
telling
you
it
's
hormonal
.

I
do
n't
know
.

%um
The
%um

She
said
%uh
she
'd
be
more
than
happy
to
.

I
said
I
think
I
said
I
I
feel
like
I
know
you
even
though
I
never
met
you
.

Very
ha-

yeah
.

and
Francis
was
,
w-
,
she
was
very
,
very
concerned
.

you
think
she
'll
be
better
with
her
mother
?

%ah
.

yup
.

uh-huh
.

%mm
.

She
said
she
was
going
to
call
you
.

She

And
she
's
not
a
cuddly
sweet
little
thing
,

and
how
are
you
?

She
's
coming
in
the
fall
,

Not
enough
relatives
left
here
anymore
?

I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.

yeah
.

Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.

And
,
then
it
w-
things
seemed
seems
to
be
seemed
to
be
doing
pretty
well
,

and
they
,
they
do
a
Punkt-
Punkt-
Punktion
.
Ich
weiss
nicht
wer
.

%um
,
and
%uh
,
we
'd
been
up
in
Berlin

and
he
's
doing
very
very
well
.
%um
,

And
so
I
think
they
told
me
that
.

and
all
of
a
sudden
she
's
getting
conference
papers
rejected

Ron
is
working
as
a
financial
consultant
for
,
%um
,
Meryl
Lynch
.

Whatever
's
helpful
.

Amazing
,

And
And

and
he
is
Great
still
in
academic
publishing
.

so
that
's
great
.

yeah

And
it
was
just
right
.

We
found
h-
another
one
for
half
the
price
for
sixty
-
six
thousand

yep
.

we
just
share

And
that
is
what
it
was
like
too
you
know
.

oh
Alison
he
is
beautiful
.

oh
.

and
little
Audrey

Are
you
working
at
all
?

and
it
's
only
one
day
a
week

Because
I
always
taught
those
two
mornings
two
to
three
ever
since
I
've
had
the
babies

What
time
is
it
there
?

How
are
you
?

You
know
that
you
know
that
what
you
're
saying
is
going
to
be
heard
.

Believe
it
or
not
.

but
you
know
because
because
he
was
premature
,
he
's
getting
a
lot
of
attention
.

Once
a
week
.

Right
,

So
you
know
,
this
he
had
to
have
you
know
an-
%eh
a
mask
thing
and
%hm
and
these
%eh
you
know

they
're
fine
.

And
that
was
good
.

I
was
in
front
of
the
computer
actually
,
when
you
called
.

so
,
%uh
.

I
do
n't
know
.

I
'm
working
on

It
's
always
hanging
over
your
head
.

It
's
like
there
is
a
bomb
waiting
to
go
off
always
.

oh
you
know
and
Phil
wanted
to
work
more
.

You
better
have
a
lot
to
tell
me
.

yeah

%ah

Gosh
.

It
seems
to
be
what
I
can
sell
at
the
moment

she
had
a
small
stroke

That
's
the
worst
part

She
was
having
a
great
deal
of
pressure
and
pain

She
had
rented
a
place
there
.

he
has
white
hair

but
he
's
paralysed
on
one
side

and
so

yeah
thank
God
,

Is
Matt
through
school
?

and
so
he
went
to
New
York
for
a
party
<ENAMEX
TYPE="DATE"
E_OFF="1">last
week-

it
's
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
except
they
've
most
of
them
have
Deloitte
Touche
Wow
developed
these
separate
wings
of
management
consultants
to
go
out
and

oh
I
got
your
%um
message
today
.

I
answered
you
back
because
I
I
was
like
oh
he
is
at
another
time
because
I
I
read
your
message

No
I
just
started
.

I
mean
just
read
in
the
post

Because
I
have
not
left
my

I
I
am
going
to
take
the
train
,
I
think
.

yeah
,

but
I
think
she
does
n't
want
me
to
go
through
all
that
trouble

she
has
.

so
I
left
her
a
message
to
her

Like
someone
me
today

%um
I
guess
that
w-
what
I
had
heard
bad
about
it
was
just
that
they
were
so
into
talking
about
like
%um
the
Koran
and
stuff
but
they
that
they
were
n't
using
this
as
being
like
a
tool
for
social
change
at
all
like
they
were
n't
talking
about
what
we
could
possibly
do
%mm
.
As
Muslims
to
like
improve
the
world
but
rather
just
well
just
spend
all
your
time
praying
kind
of
philosophy
.

and
%um

and
I
was
like
no
you
do
n't
do
that
to
your
girlfriend
,

yeah
,

I
'm
going
to
need
three
because
my
first
two
years
I
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
I
did
with
those

English
literature
and
not
li-
literature
,
right
?

Anyway
%um

we
can
go
see
%uh
go
see
some
stuff
.

But
we
,
we
got
to
see
Den
Haag
and
places
like
that
too
which
we
're
obviously
not
going
to
see
this
time
.

oh
do
they
?

uh-huh
.

Have
dual
citizenship
?

yeah
.

but
j-
,
we
'll
still
owe
some
taxes
.

I
mean
you
're

I
had
to
file
Georgia
,
Kansas
and
yeah
and
then
my
federal
.

but
if
you
do
n't
get
email
then
just
call
Anya
's
parents

and
then
Dutch
it
's
Mifrau

and
%um

So
we
just
decided
okay
,
we
'll
go
.

and
,
and
yet
it
's
still
pretty
exotic
,
you
know
.

You
know
I
need
to
give
myself
the
extra
support
when
I
get
up
.

uh-huh
.

and
it
's
totally
bizarre
.

but
if
I
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
he
is
,
he
does
kick

You
'll
see
when
you
get
pregnant
.

For
,
for
spina
bifida
and
stuff
?

and
we
did
n't
do
any
of
the
testing
because
,
like
,
I
,
I
've
met
like
three
people
since
I
got
pregnant
,
where
the
baby
had
Down
's
,
right
.

But
then
I
figured
,
well
,
I
'll
just
go
through
the
nine
months
of
pregnancy
and
then
the
baby
will
die
when
it
's
born
.
You
know
.

you
know
it
's
dead
.

Or
,
or
maybe
it
it
went
into
oxygen
deficiency
or
something
.

That
's
huge
.

oh
my
god
.

she
%um

second
of
all
you
know
it
's
like
it
all
sort
of
like
ends
up

I
have
problems
letting

but
I
I
did
n't
get
I
thought
I
'd
have
more
work
this
month
than
I
did

wait

%um
no

first
of
all
%um
is
it
weird
like
I
came
I
've
been
out
here
for
about
six
weeks
now
.

like
you
're
so
lucky

yeah

%um

I
did
the
first
month
that
I
was
here
I
took
a
class
in
digital
music
%um
which
is
like
electronic
you
know
like
music
editing
and
stuff
like
that
.

I
do
n't
know
who
else
that
you
know
has
an
email
address

and
then
you
can
get
access
to
all
any
as
any
information
you
really
need

No
I
'm
joking
with
you

Hi

these
are
like
graduate
students
I
think

Tell
me
what
's
going
on
in
America
.

So
he
's
trying
to
,
k-
kind
of
walking
a
tight
rope
.

Another
thing
that
just
came
up
was
that
the
Supreme
Court
said
that
the
redistricting
of
the
congressional
districts
one
of
which
is
in
Georgia
violated
the
Constitution
because
it
was
based
primarily
on
race
.

yeah
.

So
now
is
that
Right
.
is
that
really
remedying
the
situation

so
.

You
did
n't
say
what
your
new
job
was
.

we
're
adding
they
're
adding
thousands
of
dollars
of
%uh
state
of
the
art
language
e-
you
know
equipment
%uh
lab
equipment
and
all
of
that

that
that
's
going
to
be
regular
program

You
did
n't
know
that

However

Commander

says
,
the

firm
in
its
assessment
that
the

was
the

not
a

,
man
.

Well
,
those
who
have
not
been
able
to
do
things
for
71
years
are
not
the
best
advice
I
can
get
.

This
journey
started
at
6:45
a.m.
,
and
it
does
n't
look
like
there
's
any
promise
of
getting
out
of
here
tonight
.

On
homecoming
night
Postville
feels
like
Hometown
,
USA
,
but
a
look
around
this
town
of
2,000
shows
it
's
become
a
miniature
Ellis
Island
.

Iowa
's
governor
is
now
looking
to
follow
Postville
's
example
,
relaxing
immigration
quotas
.

I
think
it
's
asking
more
of
the
FDA
than
it
should
be
asked
to
turn
it
into
a
wildlife
agency
.

The
courtroom
was
packed
.

They
say
that
no
matter
which
way
the
court
rules
,
it
will
not
provide
nearly
so
much
finality
to
this
presidential
election
.

The
money
,
at
least
at
first
,
will
come
from
the
U.S.
treasury
.

Investigators
have
come
up
with
a
series
of
names
of
possible
suspects
found
on
papers
in
the
houses
and
cars
they
searched
.

Everywhere
else
in
the
country
,
Americans
were
stopped
momentarily
in
their
tracks
to
think
of
the
mess
that
may
lie
ahead
.

In
Yemen
today
,
Navy
divers
cut
through
the
deck
of
the
``
USS
Cole
''
to
remove
the
last
four
sailors
who
died
in
the
attack
.

Senior
Palestinian
security
officials
said
today
they
can
do
nothing
to
quell
the
unrest
until
Israel
lifts
its
blockade
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
.

In
other
words
,
the
environment
here
was
damaged
,
in
part
,
because
so
many
people
come
to
marvel
at
it
.

If
you
lose
it
,
it
's
gone
.

There
are
a
lot
of
complexities
in
Social
Security
in
both
of
these
plans
.

The
Yemenis
have
been
very
cooperative
in
providing
additional
security
,
both
in
the
harbour
,
on
land
and
to
our
people
.

Russian
athletes
were
uncomfortably
mute
when
their
new
lyric-less
anthem
was
played
.

Any
details
or
speculation
on
who
specifically
,
we
do
n't
know
that
at
this
point
.

These
days
,
Gaza
's
central
market
is
filled
with
people
who
need
to
sell
.

Palestinians
say
,
strangling
them
economically
is
only
going
to
make
things
worse
.

Here
's
ABC
's
Mike
Lee
.

The
suspect
said
it
took
months
to
repackage
and
redesign
the
load
of
high
explosives
that
was
eventually
used
against
``
the
Cole
.
''

S
did
indeed
buy
herself
a
Yankees
cap
and
a
$
200
million
house
and
the
next
senator
from
New
York
will
be
Hillary
Clinton
.

58
%
to
Rick
Lazio
's
41
%
.

It
will
also
be
among
the
most
important
.

Al
Gore
.

Those
in
the
region
are
in
the
highest
state
of
alert
after
U.S.
intelligence
has
picked
up
,
serious
,
incredible
threats
there
.

It
could
be
that
they
're
not
actually
involved
in
finishing
up
writing
one
of
the
opinions
.

It
's
also
in
dispute
because
some
people
in
this
race
can
not
accept
losing
a
popularity
contest
.

We
are
used
to
the
Israeli
political
system
,
always
tied
and
always
tied
up
,
and
election
nights
here
too
close
to
call
more
often
than
not
,
but
what
you
're
experiencing
over
there
is
really
inconceivable
to
Israelis
.

Well
,
sure
.

Thanks
,
Brian
.

I
'm
sure
she
will
have
programs
and
initiatives
.

Nothing
that
Barbara
Bush
did
or
said
,
with
due
respect
,
addressed
it
in
an
important
way
.

It
very
well
could
,
although
,
I
must
say
that
the
Gore
campaign
has
been
somewhat
disappointed
by
the
number
of
votes
they
have
not
received
thus
far
in
the
counties
that
are
undertaking
the
manual
recounts
,
Brian
,
but
a
lot
of
hand
counts
still
must
be
tallied
.

I
'm
flipping
through
the
summary
of
enacts
because
that
is
not
important
.

Their
decision
is
now
being
reviewed
.

Both
sides
have
gone
negative
,
but
advisors
say
Bush
will
avoid
getting
personally
involved
for
fear
of
a
backlash
,
leaving
his
top
aides
to
attack
Gore
by
calling
him
a
serial
exaggerator
.

He
was
switched
to
a
backup
car
.

They
say
Gore
is
not
simply
trying
to
drag
out
the
inevitable
,
that
he
does
have
a
shot
at
winning
with
a
careful
shot
of
legal
and
public
relations
tactics
.

However
,
I
have
with
me
our
general
counsel
,
Debbie
Kerny
and
two
of
our
outside
counsel
,
Joe
Clock
and
Deborah
Blanton
and
asked
them
to
remain
behind
and
answer
appropriate
questions
from
you
.

President
wants
America
and
Europe
to
stand
side
by
side
in
the
world
.

The
split
now
palpable
.

Because
as
A.P.
has
continued
with
its
numbers
the
progression
has
been
consistent
.

Jim
Miklaszewski
,
NBC
News
,
the
Pentagon
.

There
's
no
other
choice
.

They
say
the
plane
took
off
,
clicking
the
construction
equipment
,
slamming
into
the
ground
and
then
breaking
up
.

I
think
the
word
you
're
looking
for
is
flammable
.

You
're
under
a
lot
of
pressure
.

You
do
run
.

They
've
already
been
cheated
.

The
volcano
is
almost
18,000
feet
high
.

Is
that
true
?

Yes
,
Dalila
,
the
concluding
statement
of
the
Riyadh
summit
warned
against
the
partition
of
Iraq
and
demanded
that
parties
it
left
unnamed
not
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
Iraq
.

He
was
not
tempted
by
money
nor
moved
by
greed
.

And
we
begin
our
conversation
with
His
Excellency
the
Ambassador
Mr.
Nasser
.

The
president
of
the
republic
is
,
ah
,
entrusted
with
the
constitution
,

From
Turkey
,

The
Hamas
movement
declared
its
position
and
will
not
change
this
position
,
that
it
wo
n't
accept
these
elections
and
this
attempt
to
--
the
coup
on
the
will
of
the
Palestinian
people
.

The
microphones
were
disconnected
.

Parliament
has
approved
dispatching
forces
to
help
us
train
,
uh
,
the
national
forces
.

Yes
,
yes
,
but
this
can
be
compensated
for
by
the
street
.

They
also
have
an
effect
on
the
upcoming
parliamentary
and
presidential
elections
.

Today
,
and
after
traversing
much
distance
on
the
way
to
joining
,
Ankara
finds
itself
again
clashing
with
European
justifications
and
claims
that
prevent
it
from
reaching
its
goal
.

Arab
League
Secretary
General
Amr
Moussa
,
who
is
apprehensive
of
the
devil
in
the
details
,
carried
what
he
had
in
his
bag
and
tirelessly
made
the
rounds
of
those
involved
in
the
current
crisis
.

In
the
meantime
,
Iraqi
Foreign
Minister
Hoshyar
al
-
Zebari
called
during
his
meeting
with
Egyptian
President
Hosni
Mubarak
for
supporting
the
efforts
of
Iraqi
reconciliation
.

His
victory
by
a
strong
majority
will
grant
a
clear
mandate
to
remove
restrictions
on
presidential
terms
and
to
establish
a
single
party
that
he
is
expected
to
lead
in
power
for
decades
.

And
any
political
escalation
also
,
uh
,
uh
,
is
likely
to
%pw
%pw
fuel
the
internal
situation
which
is
going
towards
infighting
,
as
we
saw
in
Gaza
and
as
we
saw
in
the
West
Bank
,
particularly
,
uh
,
uh
,
in
Nablus
.

Suppose
they
were
established
in
El
Salvador
,
then
in
Guatemala
and
maybe
in
Honduras
during
the
eighties
:
if
we
had
not
taken
the
steps
we
took
,
the
direct
suffering
would
have
been
much
greater
.

In
addition
to
the
terrorist
,
as
the
authorities
call
him
,
two
Syrian
security
men
were
injured
.

So
in
just
a
few
seconds
,
Hurricane
Durian
transformed
more
than
one
province
into
ruins
and
carried
away
dear
ones
,
leaving
behind
lakes
of
water
,
mud
,
destruction
and
sorrow
.

Observers
do
not
expect
the
predictions
of
Noboa
,
who
fought
his
third
presidential
battle
armed
with
money
,
to
come
true
:
that
a
civil
war
would
erupt
if
his
forty
-
three
-
year
-
old
rival
,
Correa
,
won
.

It
has
become
known
,
uh
,
the
various
March
14
groups
,
uh
,
called
on
their
partisans
and
supporters
to
participate
in
this
national
,
popular
funeral
tomorrow
after
calling
a
general
strike
day
in
mourning
for
the
young
Minister
Gemayel
.

The
former
ruling
Republican
Party
for
Renewal
considers
that
its
modest
results
are
expected
,
given
that
it
was
targeted
by
the
Mauritanian
authorities
,
which
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
many
of
its
members
.

After
the
talks
,
Ambassador
Suleiman
Awwad
,
official
spokesman
for
the
presidency
of
the
republic
,
said
that
the
two
Presidents
Mubarak
and
Nguema
focused
in
their
closed
and
expanded
talks
on
the
overall
situation
in
the
African
arena
,
on
strengthening
relations
,
and
discussed
the
agenda
of
the
next
African
summit
.

But
Moussa
's
visit
to
Beirut
this
time
assumes
great
importance
as
he
is
returning
from
a
meeting
that
was
described
as
important
with
the
Saudi
King
,
Abdallah
Bin
Abd
-
al
-
Aziz
;
and
consequently
,
obviously
just
the
return
is
expected
to
bring
something
new
that
contributes
to
paving
the
road
for
some
solution
,
at
least
in
form
.

In
principle
also
,
all
the
political
mediations
which
were
widely
talked
about
yesterday
morning
,
were
voided
by
nighttime
,
because
the
calculations
of
the
minority
or
the
opposition
do
not
correspond
at
all
with
those
of
the
majority
or
the
loyalists
.

At
the
same
time
,
at
least
292
people
are
still
amongst
the
missing
and
it
is
feared
that
they
may
have
died
as
well
.

GOP
vice
-
presidential
nominee
Dick
Cheney
celebrated
Thanksgiving
in
a
Washington
D.C.
hospital
where
he
is
recovering
from
what
doctors
said
was
a
mild
heart
attack
.

The
BBC
's
Barbara
Platt
reports
.

He
invited
both
Slobodan
Milosevic
and
Vojislav
Kostunica
to
Moscow
for
talks
.

Barak
had
hoped
to
open
today
's
session
by
announcing
the
formation
of
a
national
emergency
unity
government
with
Ariel
Sharon
's
opposition
Likud
Party
,
but
negotiations
this
past
weekend
to
form
such
a
coalition
were
inconclusive
.

Critics
argued
that
the
anthem
is
a
throwback
to
the
former
totalitarian
government
.

Then
they
may
send
in
a
television
camera
,
a
remote
-
controled
television
camera
to
have
a
look
around
and
see
what
the
conditions
are
like
,
and
then
,
based
upon
the
weather
conditions
,
a
decision
will
be
made
whether
to
go
inside
and
begin
the
search
for
bodies
.

They
have
said
that
it
was
either
a
collision
with
a
foreign
submarine
,
it
could
have
been
a
collision
with
a
World
War
II
mine
,
or
it
could
have
been
a
torpedo
on
board
misfiring
.

He
is

the
Cultural
Revolution

At
least
four
more
people
were
killed
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
with
both
sides
blaming
each
other
for
the
bloodshed
.

Are
they
hopeful
something
might
come
out
of
this
?

The
World
's
Richard
Myron
speaking
to
us
from
Tel
Aviv
.

Is
that
correct
?

With
this
month
's
ouster
of
strongman
Slobodan
Milosevic
,
Yugoslavia
is
rapidly
joining
the
international
community
.

But
with
Milosevic
out
of
the
way
,
what
next
for
Serbia
's
most
popular
satirical
group
?

So
I
think
that
,
I
think
it
was
meant
to
be
a
lap
of
honor
whether
or
not
he
salvages
the
peace
process
because
we
have
actually
had
too
much
of
the
President
.

Five
Palestinians
were
killed
yesterday
bringing
the
overall
death
toll
to
more
than
140
.

What
did
President
Fox
have
to
say
?

He
said
that
the
previous
President
Ernesto
Zedillo
was
too
much
of
a
servant
to
the
United
States
.

Hezbollah
is
saying
one
thing
,
the
Israelis
are
saying
another
and
when
we
are
talking
about
a
possible
member
of
the
secret
services
of
Mossad
,
it
is
very
hard
for
any
one
but
the
Israelis
to
know
for
sure
.

I
mean
those
who
have
criticized
the
Israeli
withdrawal
for
its
troops
from
Southern
Lebanon
last
spring
have
said
that
it
showed
that
the
armed
uprisings
have
won
the
day
and
forced
the
Israeli
pullout
.

AIDS

Immune

.

He
has
said
something
that
has
caused
a
lot
of
confusion
.

Speaking
at
the
Cole
's
home
base
in
Norfolk
,
Virginia
,
Admiral
John
Foley
said
that
the
Navy
is
investigating
the
incident
.

So
,
I
think
terrorists
prevented
from
attacking
their
targets
using
their
more
conventional
means
`
truck
bombs
'
have
merely
adjusted
their
tactics
slightly
and
obviously
they
have
been
successful
with
it
today
.

Many
of
them
are
stranded
amid
scenes
of
desolation
.

The
biggest
democracy
in
the
world
and
it
's
all
falling
apart
.

I
do
n't
really
have
any
concerns
at
all
.

Given
that
he
has
already
controlled
a
majority
of
the
National
Assembly
,
it
is
very
likely
that
the
law
will
be
passed
and
the
general
feeling
is
that
there
is
a
hurry
in
approving
the
legislation
because
the
President
seems
to
feel
that
he
is
running
out
of
time
with
the
popular
support
he
has
gotten
ever
since
1998
.

the

it
's
still
too
soon
to
draw
conclusions
.

He
did
n't
need
to
do
this
.

if
the

sounds

it
comes
straight
out

,
well
,
you
are
not
far
off
.

They
do
n't
realize
that
you
know
the
real
execution
is
really
black

black

A

call
also
represents
something
of
a
coup
for

,
which
is
anxious

I
advised

there

For
those
who
attacked
them
we
say
you
will
not
found
the
safe
harbour
.

If
they
offered
you
only
,
say
,
a
fully
western
menu
,
would
it
still
appeal
to
you
?

Ironically
,
what
the
Western
fast
food
chains
are
doing
here
is
the
same
as
what
Indian
restaurants
have
done
and
been
very
successful
at
in
the
United
States
and
Europe
,
adapting
and
adjusting
according
to
local
tastes
.

The

NPR
's
Jennifer
Loden
reports
.

But
not
everyone
thinks
recovering
the
bodies
is
a
good
idea
.

There
are
three
main
theories
.

Let
's
back
up
for
a
minute
.

In
Bethlehem
Palestinians
buried
another
victim
of
the
current
troubles
killed
in
fighting
yesterday
with
the
Israeli
Army
,
but
as
the
casualties
on
both
sides
continue
to
mount
,
there
are
also
rumors
of
high
level
secret
contacts
between
the
Israelis
and
the

Basically
it
is
not
such
a
threatening
sort
of
bit
of
a
news
as
it
might
seem
at
the
moment
because
the

I
wonder
in

this
particular

,
now
this
is
certainly
an
extreme
case
in

United

unfathomably
close

How
have

could
there

be

What
happens

By
March
of
last
year
they
had
given
up

The
claim
is
that
this
would
engender
tremendously
destabilizing
consequences
that
in
any
event
it
might
be
a
very
,
very
bloody
affair
and
so
on

The
Americans
were
involved
as
far
as
assessing
and
evaluating
the
validity
of
the
elections
,
and
I
think
this
grew
out
of
that
policy
of
supporting
the
Yemeni
government
,
but
again
the
problem
that
the
Yemeni
government
faces
is
they

forgo

that

This
happens
to
be

good

where
we
're
close

the
geometry
works
out

Hi
there

It

in

Besides

Washington
,

,
has
already
treated
more
than

twice

practicing
man
overboard

knowing
where
to
go
,
where
to
report
to
if
indeed
a
man
overboard
takes
place
and
as
the
deployment
begins
,
those
wane
off
,
but
they
know
where
to
go
quickly
.

There
's
a
number
of
reasons
to
look
at
.

That
data
will
be
sent
back
to

I
think
that

is
a
little
out
of
context
there

I
think
there
are
a
number
of
other
measures
that
tell
how
--
or
indicate
how
well
somebody
's
doing
running
a
company
,
and
I
think
corporation
boards
need
to
spend
more
time
on
that
dimension
.

That
's
not
the
question
I
asked
you
.

It

Since

this

What
was
it
you
were
looking
at
when
you
looked
out
over
the
waters
?

I
'm
not
sure
if
you
have
been
able
to
see
some
of
these
pictures
playing
on
the
television
sets
around
the
world
but
we
look
at
these
pictures
and
think
there
's
no
way
a
cruise
ship
,
as
big
as
it
is
,
will
be
able
to
maneuver
into
position
in
these
kinds
of
heavy
seas
to
save
three
corks
out
there
on
the
water

One
star
told
Vanity
Fair
their
favorite
author
is
whoever
wrote
the
Bible

That
was
the
great
thing
about

shoot
.

And
Hilary
Duff
is
a
star
,
and
I
guarantee
you
,
they
will
grace
their
own

It
's
the
young
people
he
needs
to
appeal
to
.

He
was
a

who
once
closed
a
restaurant
he
owned
rather
than

African

Americans

The
``
L.A.
Times
''
reporting
that
negotiations
are
continuing
and
will
resume
tomorrow
.

It
is
,
in
fact
,
the
deadliest
conflict
since
World
War
II
and
has
been
going
on
for
five
years
.

They
've
been
disagreeing
on
union
opposed
bill
on

time

Later
,
he
's
supposed
to
helicopter
to
Jericho
on
the
West
Bank
to
meet
with
the
Palestinian
Prime
Minister
Mahmoud
Abbas
.

That
's
according
to
the
National
Catholic
Reporter
.

Before
I
tell
you
how
big
those
parachutes
are
,
let
me
tell
you
what
the
U.S.
Treasury
Secretary
is
saying
about
it
now
.

To
continue
a
pregnancy
that
her
lawyer
says
she
is
not
aware
of
but
the
decision
was
n't
based
on
the
advice
of
the
governor
.

Of
course
,
according
to
the
guardian
,
she
's
very
worried
about
that
,
too
,
and
she
has
warned
the
court
that
she
hopes
the
mother
will
be
placed
in
a
better
home
when
all
of
this
is
over
,
one
where
she
is
far
better
protected
than
she
was
by
the
state
in
a
home
where
police
say
she
was
raped
.

That
does
include
the
Magellan
Fund
which
is
its
biggest
.

It
's
come
to
stealing
childrens
books
,
has
it
?

Their
story
is
remarkable

Yeah

Suddenly
we
realized
water
came
into
the
engine
room
and
it
was
rising
and
they
started
to
pump
,
of

and
they
pumped
and
pumped
and
the
water
came
more
and
more
and
more

Worst
job

Would
you

And
Buzz

more

A
little
earlier
this
morning

I
spoke
with
an
Iraqi
dissident
who
teaches
and
writes
extensively
on
the
Middle
East
.

Speaking
of
chicks
--
call
it
puppy
love
,
call
it
maternal
instinct
,
but
,
mostly
it
's
just
out
of
the
ordinary
.

The
Scotts
ran
it
past

the

assured
them
if
a

as

she
was
no

We
leave
you
with
sounds
from
Willie
Nelson
,
the
country
legend
is
celebrating
his
70th
birthday
.

The
network
has
not
said
where
it
got
the
tape
.

He
is
in
good
condition
with
the
172nd
Fire
Squadron
which
is
based
in
Battle
Creek
,
Michigan
,
but
he
's
a
very
lucky
man
.

It
looks
like
an
annual
tradition
is
building
.

It
's
not
just
clapping
and
having
a
good
time
.

In
the
short
term
,
that
's
going
to
have
to
mean
the
American
military
,
but
the
key
question
,
which
I
try
to
address
in
the
book
,
is
What
do
you
do
after
that
?
What
kind
of
authority
do
you
create
in
a
society
going
through
this
kind
of
transition
.

These
tree
branches
cushioned

we

face
stiff
resistance
from
Iraqi
paramilitary

The
idea

almost

A
little
later
we
'll
speak
with

take
a
closer
look
at
the
daring
operation
that
produced
her

but
first
the

Our
top
story
this
hour
,
the
discovery
of
suspect
chemical
weapons
materials
at
an
agricultural
complex
in
central
Iraq
.

It
gives
you
a
sense
of
,
perhaps
what
50
years
of
tension
and
war
will
do
to
your
mentality
,
but
it
does
also
say
that
the
Israelis
are
a
bit
more
blase
,
if
that
's
a
fair
word
for
it
,
than
perhaps
we
are
.

We
thank

explosions
rocking

The

Yes
,
well
,
yesterday
the
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
,
uh
,
at
this
routine
press
conference
,
especially
answered
reporters
with
regard
to
this
kind
of
questions
.

Furthermore
,
of

Well
,
with
regard
to
the
US
,
uh
,
if
it
did
not
change
its
position
,
this
editorial
also
said
,
it
would
then
be
impossible
to
hold
the
six
-
party
talks
on
the
North
Korea
nuclear
issue
in
December
,
nor
would
it
be
possible
in
the
future
unless
the
US
changed
its
position
.

Schwab
said
that
over
the
past
one
year
,
there
are
various
signs
indicating
that
the
momentum
of
China
's
economic
reform
has
been
starting
to
slow
down
,
and
the
voices
opposing
further
implementing
market
liberalization
in
China
have
been
intensifying
;
the
government
,
particularly
the
provincial
government
,
has
also
been
enhancing
its
interventional
power
in
the
economy
.

The
notification
also
makes
clear
the
specific
requirements
of
the
one

time
evaluation
and
recognition
for
some
qualified
senior
Taiwanese
architects
.

Yet
another
Chinese
reporter
has
been
arrested
.

On
the

,
the
European
Parliament
passed
new
automobile

Inspectors
from
Tainan
went
to
the
scene
of
the

on

to
investigate
the
cause
of
the

At

The

This
is
also
the
main
reason
why
car

have

dropped
at
the
end
of

.

After
the
bomb
attack
occured
,
and
since
the
evening
of
that
day
,
an
indefinite
curfew
has
been
imposed
in
Baghdad
City
.

At
3:30
p.m.
,
the
parade
officially
began
amid
the
loud
sounds
emitted
by
firecrackers
.

Finally
,
he
was
repeatedly
checked
by
the
presiding

who
sternly
demanded

issue
of
so
-
called
unconstitutionality
again
.

As
for
the
Iranian
problem
,
eh
,
Iran
's
deputy
foreign
minister
Mohammed
said
on
Wednesday
that
his
Ministry
would
conduct
a
two
-
day
meeting
beginning
next
Monday
,
and
would
discuss
the
scope
of
Germany
's
massacre
of
Jews
during
World
War
II
.

However
,
from
the
known
portions
of
the
new
exam
questions
,
future
exams
will
assess
naturalization
applicants
'
knowledge
in
areas
like
American
social
and
political
history
;
and
applicants
need
to
extend
and
elaborate
their
answers
.

In
the
last
two
days
,
all
of
the
major
electrical
appliance
stores
in
Urumqi
have
also
seen
electric
heaters
selling
out
.

Because
of
this
,
they
think
that
these
special
and
rare
microbes
have
already
gained
some
kind
of
ability
to
resist
powerful
radiation
while
maintaining
moisture
.

In
particular
,
they
also
point
out
the
time
and
place
of
job
fairs
that
day
.

For
example
,
the
report
even
just
briefly
touches
on
military
withdrawal
,
an
issue
of
the
most
concern
.

After
over
two
years
of
investigation
,
Italian
inspection
personnel
believed
that
a
total
of
six
Italians
and
26
Americans
--
among
whom
,
22
were
CIA
agents
--
were
involved
in
this
illegal
kidnapping
case
.

In
the
process
of
world
unification
,
the
rights
of
minority
groups
must
be
protected
,
for
example
,
their
cultural
traditions
and
religions
.

Of
course
,
this
picture
,
uh
,
was
also
drawn
based
on
the
recovered
portrait
of
the
fossil
.

However
,
the
press
briefing
room
was
only
open
to
Korean
reporters
.

A
Xinhua
News
Agency
article
said
that
the
talks
will
enter
the
stage
of
documenting
the
progress
in
written
form
.

According
to
reports
,
related
CIA
officials
said
none
of
the
people
mentioned
on
the
list
were
directly
related
to
Iran
's
secret
nuclear
program
.

This
achievement
made
his
father
very
happy
.

Fortunately
,
the
two
both
managed
to
survive
.

The
communique
also
said
that
the
military
government
will
impose
curfew
if
necessary
,
calling
on
the
Fijian
people
to
give
support
and
exercise
patience
.

So
,
now
,
er
,
the
US
Treasury
Department
has
brought
out
an
announcement
,
saying
that
these
,
ah
,
the
fake
notes
,
ah
,
produced
by
North
Korea
,
um
,
were
actually
produced
and
circulated
with
the
agreement
of
the
government
,
and
under
the
management
and
control
of
the
government
.

Under
such
circumstances
,
there
is
no
need
for
OPEC
to
continue
reducing
production
.

Altering
from
the
previous
sentinel
-
based
protection
mode
,
troops
were
sent
to
the
field
to
conduct
a
completely
new
safeguard
training
in
a
mobile
operation
field
,
so
as
to
train
safeguard
personnel
in
a
simulated
war
environment
and
enhance
their
safeguard
capabilities
.

According
to
the
Singaporean
regulations
,
schools
whose
Protection
Scheme
eligibility
has
been
revoked
or
suspended
by
the
Consumer
Association
shall
not
be
able
to
enroll
foreign
students
any
more
or
must
suspend
the
enrollment
of
foreign
students
.

The
election
battles
for
the
mayors
of
Taipei
and
Kaohsiung
are
entering
a
white
-
hot
sprinting
stage
,
as
candidates
from
both
the
blue
and
the
green
camps
are
exerting
an
all
-
out
effort
.

The
four
,
all
Yemenis
,
were
picked
up
over
the
weekend
by
that
country
's
police
.

The
entire
operation
fits
the
pattern
of
Osama
Bin
Laden
who
had
already
carried
out
attacks
against
American
targets
.

And
one
of
the
longest
running
struggles
for
international
justice
reached
a
milestone
today
of
sorts
,
when
a
Scottish
court
,
meeting
in
the
Netherlands
,
finally
officially
found
someone
guilty
in
the
1988
bombing
that
brought
down
Pan
Am
Flight
103
.

Not
yet
,
says
President
George
W.
Bush
,
at
the
White
House
today
,
demanding
that
Khaddafi
meet
certain
conditions
first
,
to
accept
responsibility
for
this
act
,
and
to
compensate
the
families
.

We
will
never
have
a
perfect
defense
against
terrorism
,
but
we
need
to
make
our
defenses
as
good
as
they
can
be
.

I
could
not
be
more
happy
.

NBC
's
Jim
Miklaszewski
has
the
latest
.

They
're
focusing
on
an
abandoned
apartment
where
bomb
-
making
materials
were
found
,
but
today
,
the
Yemen
President
claims
that
the
explosive
found
could
only
come
from
the
U.S.
or
Israel
,
implying
that
the
materials
or
the
weapon
itself
were
Western
-
made
.

Details
have
yet
to
be
revealed
,
but
at
the
very
least
,
sources
say
,
there
was
an
exchange
of
guarantees
for
Kostunica
,
a
peaceful
hand
-
over
of
power
,
and
in
return
,
safety
and
comfort
inside
Serbia
for
Milosevic
.

Tonight
for
both
George
Bush
and
Al
Gore
and
their
war
rooms
all
their
advisers
,
this
really
comes
down
to
a
numbers
game
.

`T
is
the
season
to
send
Americans
shipping
--
190
million
packages
between
Thanksgiving
and
Christmas
,
many
purchased
online
,
but
internet
retailers
,
once
a
force
behind
the
boom
,
now
fighting
for
their
very
survival
,
and
many
say
the
one
to
watch
is
eToys
.

The
question
tonight
,
will
it
survive
to
help
play
Santa
Claus
next
year
?

If
Gore
wins
,
Lieberman
would
resign
his
Senate
seat
and
almost
certainly
be
replaced
by
a
Republican
,
appointed
by
Connecticut
's
Republican
governor
.

It
's
normally
a
routine
operation
,
so
no
one
aboard
the
``
Cole
''
has
the
slightest
suspicion
the
ship
is
about
to
be
attacked
.

Arriving
at
church
with
his
family
Sunday
--

Man
,
I
was
overjoyed
.

In
all
our
polling
,
Americans
have
rated
education
as
the
number
one
issue
in
this
election
.

First
,
Gore
's
deduction
is
limited
to
$
10,000
per
family
,
not
per
child
,
as
he
said
.

It
's
really
more
rhetoric
than
substance
.

Joe
Johns
,
NBC
News
,
the
White
House
.

What
's
going
on
at
this
busy
airport
,
and
why
is
it
affecting
travelers
all
around
the
country
?

It
's
the
first
time
in
14
years
that
the
government
resorts
to
a
lottery
like
this
to
regulate
the
number
of
flights
at
an
airport
.

We
do
not
want
our
legacy
to
be
a
controversy
.

Why
?

For
the
Bush
campaign
,
a
victory
in
the
willingness
of
the
Supreme
Court
to
play
some
role
in
overseeing
the
Florida
system
and
the
Florida
judicial
decision
making
process
.

On
the
diplomatic
front
,
the
U.S.
said
the
government
of
Yemen
is
cooperating
with
the
investigation
,
though
that
country
's
President
disputes
charges
that
his
nation
is
a
haven
for
terrorists
.

The
former
cabinet
member
and
oil
industry
executive
so
formal
and
business
-
like
on
the
campaign
trail
,
critics
complain
some
appearances
have
all
the
excitement
of
a
Defense
Department
briefing
.

The
last
time
presidential
candidates
had
that
luxury
was
in
1960
--
Richard
Nixon
and
John
F.
Kennedy
facing
off
over
a
$
300
million
surplus
,
not
adjusted
for
inflation
.

The
truth
?

it

started
to

,
that
's
what
scared
everybody
.

Lincoln
's
collapse
may
cost
taxpayers
as
much
as
$
2.5
billion
,
according
to
estimates
,
making
it
the
most
expensive
thrift
failure
in
history
.

State
thrift
examiner
Eugene
Stelzer
said
he
found
the
chief
federal

Steve
Scott
to
be
totally
uninterested
in
one
allegedly
fraudulent
series
of
transactions
.

closed
sharply
higher

in

supported
largely
by
a
technical
bounce

sharp

.

Total

in
Glaxo
was
a

Other

Monday
included
nonferrous

which
attracted
investors
because
of
a
surge
in
gold
prices
on
the

of
the
unstable

.

In
a
civil
suit
commenced
in
state
Supreme

in
New
York
,
the
agency
alleged
that
the

chain
engaged
in
deceptive
advertising
by
claiming
to
have
``
lowered

of

campaign
that

says
Lloyd

then
,
scientists
had
no
way
of
ferreting
out
specific
genes
,
but
under
a
microscope
they
could
see
the
23
pairs
of
chromosomes
in
the
cells
that
contain
the
genes
.

They
began
uncovering
a
confusing
variety
of
genetic
deletions
,
some
existing
only
in
benign
polyps
,
others
in
malignant
cells
and
many
in

Japanese

were
flat

time

Of
course
,
simply
buying
computers
does
n't
always
solve
problems
,
and
many
American
companies
have
erred
by
purchasing
technology
they
did
n't
understand

because

but
they

Mr.

much
serious

to
the
events
of
Feb.
25
,
1942
,
when
American

spotted
strange
lights
in

A

Last

the
strategy
of
playing
the
two
experts
off
each
other
blew
up
:
Mr.
Lawson
quit
in
exasperation
and
Sir
Alan
Walters
,
the

,
announced
his
resignation
within
an

.

Despite
the
departure
of
Mr.
Lawson
and
Sir
Alan
,
the
tug
-
of

over
the
EMS
could
continue
.

The
U.S.

said
that
despite
the
rapid

,
all

agreed
on
``

The

shows
clearly
the
global
power
of
Japan

financial
titans

A

ruled
that
Imelda

that

it

it

Aside
from
the
Soviet

one

Last

,
nine
months
after

the
state
attorney
general
's

indicted
him
on
a
sweeping
array
of
charges
alleging
more
than
10
years
of
``
official
oppression
''
in
Cambria
County
,
a
depressed
steel

community
in
western

But
some

worry
that
the
prominent

is
just
the
sort
of
deal
that
should
be
avoided
for
the

At
the
time
,
Japan
had
just
opened

about
250
years
of
isolation
and
needed

the

was
mistakenly

to
Christina

.

But
after
much
tracking
,
it
became
evident
to
Mr.
Stoll
,
through
various
clues
,
that
the
hacker
was
not
on
the
Berkeley
campus
or
even
in
California
.

Back
in

,
he
was
violently
scolded
by

for
consorting
with
such
people

Many

It
's
unclear
whether
Eastern
will
succeed
in
overturning
the
arbitrator
's
decision
,
made
in
a
long
-
simmering
``
pay

''
dispute
that
predates
both
the
carrier
's
Chapter
11
petition
and
its
1986
acquisition
by
Texas
Air
.

Eastern
has
disputed
the
claim
,
but
a
federal
district
court
,
an
appeals
court
and
now
the
arbitrator
have
all
sided
with
the
pilots
.

The
Committee
on
Federal
Regulation
of
Securities
for

American

Association
argues
,
for
example
,
in
its
lengthy

to
the
SEC
,
that
the
proposed
changes
``
would
substantially
improve
the

it
more

Although
September
's
weakness
followed
two
strong
months
for
home

,
the
decline
supports
other
indications
that
the
drop
in
mortgage
rates
earlier
this
year
has
had
only
a
limited
beneficial
effect
on
the
housing
market
.

Concerns
about
the
pace
of
the
Vienna
talks
--
which
are
aimed
at
the
destruction
of
some
100,000
weapons
,
as
well
as
major
reductions
and
realignments
of
troops
in
central
Europe
--
also
are
being
registered
at
the
Pentagon
.

Greece
and
Turkey
,
for
example
,
are
suspected
of
overstating
their
arsenals
in
hopes
that
they
can
emerge
from
the
arms
-
reduction
treaty
with
large
remaining
forces
to
deter
each
other
.

Also
,
a

warning
system
failed
to
alert

the
NTSB
said
.

They
will
also
tell

that
even
if
you
hate

you
can
still

During

became
dismayed
at
the

Dade

,
learning
that

intended

,
made
plans
to
arrest
him
on

-
running
charges
as
soon
as
he
hit

The
Reagan

also
put
Mr.

U.S.

.

Yet
,
his
political
setbacks
mounted

Final

--

an

including

Jesse

and
Warren
Rudman
and
Democrats
Bill
Bradley

.

And
among

the

According
to

Eastern

Experts
from

estimated
Eastern

miss
the

mark
by
$
120
million
to
$
135

,
the

Dinsa

said
:
``
There
is
little
incentive

Mr.
Goldberg
,
who
took
over
as
head
of
the
IRS
in
July
,
has
been
disturbed
by
what
he
considers
the
inefficiency
,
waste
and
lack
of
coordination
among
the
branches
of
the
vast
federal
agency
.

Above
all
,
though
,
conservative
Republicans
who
have
championed
both
the
Contras
and
SDI
are
reluctant
to
attack
a
Republican
president
for
failing
to
do
more
--
though
that
reluctance
may
be
receding
.

It
will
be
hard
down
the
road
to
persuade
Congress
to
approve
money
for
SDI
plans
if
lawmakers
fear
those
plans
could
scuttle
a
completed
treaty

In
recent
weeks
Mr.
Merksamer
has
approached
a
number
of
his

and
asked
them
to
provide
letters
of
intent
saying
they
will
continue
shipping
merchandise
to
the
chain
following

out

The

said

expanded

that
its

estimate
of
a
50

rise
in
earnings
for
all

1989
will
be
exceeded
by
a
wide
margin
.

Analysts
said
Hachette
's
earnings
in
the
second

might
be
boosted
by
a
capital
gain
from
the
sale
of
the

WITHHOLDING
RULES
:

Medieval
philosophers
used
to
hold
the
sensible
belief
that
it
was
more
perfect
to
exist

not
to
exist

and
that
to
exist
as
a
matter

necessity
was
most
perfect
of
all

A

the
endless
allusions

festooning

customarily
be
grave

spooked

Chuck

The
men
can
defeat
immunities
that
states
often
assert
in
court
by
showing
that
officials
knew
or
should
have
known
that
design
of

was
defective

that
they
failed
to
make

it

can
weigh
the

A

would
have
a
distinctive

just

have

Presidents
Kennedy

Johnson
were
both
big
users
of
the

,
but
Congress
saw
its
chance
against

stripped
it

For

The

issued

``

said
Hyman

a

In

,
Stamford

return
it
as

.

Meanwhile
,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
yesterday
approved
an
$
837.5
million
aid
package
for
Poland
and
Hungary
that
more
than
doubles
the
amount
President
Bush
had
requested
.

The
decision
is
a
setback
for
President
Bush
,
who
needs
the
support
of
Democrats
to
pass
the
tax
cut
through
the
Democratic
-
controlled
Senate

That

Mr.

Still
,
few
investors
are
able
to
sit
tight
when
they
are
convinced
a
recession
is
coming
.

Food
,
tobacco
,
drugs
and
utilities
are
the
classic
examples
.

Skeptics
say
the
slightly
higher

are
n't

to
compensate

The

typically
begins

,
takes
a
pool
of
credit

card
or
other

and
sells
them
to
a
specially

trust
.

That
's
particularly
true
,
analysts
say
,
for
certain
of
the
securities
,
such
as

This
change
comes
less
from
a
shift
in
public
opinion
,
which
has
n't
changed
much
on
abortion
over
the
past
decade
,
than
in
the
boundaries

After
losing
by
fewer

1,800
votes
in
the
1981
governor

,
he
has
prepared
himself
methodically
for
this
moment
,
including
deciding
in
recent
years
he
could
no
longer
support
curbs
on
federal
funding
for
Medicaid
abortions
.

Yet
minutes
after
promising
to
appoint
Hispanics
to
high
posts
in
state
government
,
he
is
unable
to
say
whether
he
has
ever
employed
any
in
his
congressional
office
.

His
campaign
hierarchy
is
chosen
from
elsewhere
in
the
state
,
and
faced
with
criticism
of
a
sweetheart
bank
investment
,
he
has
so
far
blunted
the
issue
by
donating
the
bulk
of
his
profits
to
his
alma

,
Trenton
State

is
some
kind

The

One

by

will
be
repaired
by

and
that
people
will
be
able
to
get
there
.

Within
a
few
minutes
,
the
true
extent
of
the
catastrophe
was
becoming
clear

The
journalistic
consensus
was
that
the
earthquake
made

Estimates
suggest
October
's
figure
may
be
even
higher
.

The
December
contract
settled
at
73.97
cents
a
pound
,
up
0.59
cent
,
but
it
rose
as
high
as
74.20
cents
.

However
,
the
French
merchant
has
about
200,000

old
crop
Ivory
Coast
cocoa
stored
in
the
Netherlands
from
an
agreement
it
had
negotiated
with
the
Ivory
Coast
last
spring
.

The
1989
act
simply
extends
these
guarantees
to
the
private
sector
.

But
given
the
political
importance
of
California
,
the
administration
was
content
to
use
its
influence
to
prevent
any
Senate
amendments
adding
further
new
appropriations
.

Separately
,
the
House
last
night
approved
a
nearly
$
67

compromise
spending

the
first
construction
funds

The
clearance
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
comes
after
two
years
of
restricted
access
for
the
youngest
victims
of
AIDS
to
the
only
antiviral
drug
yet
cleared
to
treat
the
fatal
disease
.

Still
,
all
this
comes
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
after
Philip
Pizzo
of
the
National
Cancer
Institute
offered
evidence
that
AZT
could
reverse
the
ravages
of
AIDS
dementia
,
sometimes
prompting
dramatic
recovery
of
IQ
levels
and
reappearance
of
lost
motor
skills
.

The
move
is
the
biggest
salvo
yet
in
the
renewed
outcry
against
program
trading
,
with
Kemper
putting
its
money
--
the
millions
of
dollars
in
commissions
it
generates
each
year
--
where
its
mouth
is

Small
investors
perceive
that
``
big

dominate

,
said
Thomas
O'Hara
,
chairman
of
the
National

of
Investors
and
head
of
the

Individual
Investors
Advisory
Committee
set
up
after
the
1987
crash
.

A
beaming
Mr.
Pilson
announced
his
lastest
coup
at
a
news
conference
that
afternoon
.

``
As
we
've
seen
in
the
'80s
,
''
says
Roger
Werner
,
the
president
of
the
ESPN
sports
channel
,
``
those
deals
can
turn
sour
if
the
numbers
do
n't
work
.

``
And
yet
his
company
is
one
reason
why
rights
are
so
high
today
.
''

He
sees
flashy
sports
as
the
only
way
the
last
-
place
network
can
cut
through
the
clutter
of
cable
and
VCRs
,
grab
millions
of
new
viewers
and
tell
them
about
other
shows
premiering
a
few
weeks
later
.

Moreover
,
sports
is
hardly
the
best
way
to
lure
adult
women
.

That
has
outraged
some
fans
.

``
This
is
n't
outlandish
bidding
;
this
is
a
situation
of
very
careful
businessmen
making
judgments
about
the

of
product
and
acting
on
it
...
.

What
did
he
think
of
the
Supreme
Court
's
decision
legalizing
abortion
?

Many
Americans
still
agonize
over
their
own
personal
feelings
about
abortion
.

Throughout
the
early
1980s
,
Mr.
Bush
was
quoted
sometimes
supporting
federal
funding
for
abortion
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
and
sometimes
opposing
it
.

On

claim
that

both
legal

gauge

Nine

have
introduced

eventually
followed
the

roughly

The

could

When
a
stock
falls
below
the
put
's
strike
price
,
the
investor
simply
sells
the
stock
at
a
loss
and
simultaneously
sells
the
put
at
a
profit
.

Normally

once
the

That
's
a
question
a
lot
of
people
are
asking
,
following
the
stock
market
's
stunning
display
of
volatility
.

Despite
the
strong

for
stocks
,
however
,
most
pros
warn
that
individuals
should
n't
try
to
profit
from
short

term
developments

The
pros
strenuously
advise
individuals
to
stay
away
from
the
latest
investment
fad
.

William
P.
Panny
,
MLX
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
said
the
pact
``
will
provide
MLX
with
the
additional
time
and
flexibility
necessary
to
complete
the
restructuring
of
the
company
's
capital
structure

''

That
's
the
lesson
offered
through
one
case
study
featured
in
a
design
exhibit
.

His
crude
device
worked
:
The
lower
teeth
gathered

leaves
into

while
the

harder
teeth
moved
the
top
of
the
pile

And
,
if
still
conscious
at
the
evening
's
end
,
you
notice
something
else
:
The
audience
,
at
first
entranced
and
hypnotized
by
the
music
,
releases
its
pent
-
up
feelings
in
collective
gratitude
.

Nothing
bravura
,
no
arpeggios
,
no
ticklish
fingering
problems
challenge
the
performer
.

Admirers
of
Mr.
Glass
may
agree
with
the
critic
Richard
Kostelanetz
's
sense
that
the
1974
``
Music
in
Twelve
Parts
''
is
as
encyclopedic
and
weighty
as
``
The
Well

Tempered

Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restrictions
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
markets
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
orders
.

But
at
a
meeting
last
week
,
Tom
Donovan
,
the
Board
of
Trade
's
president
,
told
commodity

:
``
Dual
trading

definitely
worth
saving

When
the
dust
and
dirt
settle
in
an
extra-nasty
mayoral
race
,
the
man
most
likely
to
gain
custody
of
all
this
is
a
career
politician
named
David
Dinkins
.

And
after
a
decade
of
explosive
job
growth
on
Wall
Street
,
a
period
of
contraction
is
under
way
.

Critics
have
said
the
payment
looked
like
an
attempt
by
the
Dinkins
camp
to
get
Mr.
Carson
to
stop
leading
confrontational
demonstrations
protesting
the
Bensonhurst
murder
--
protests
the
campaign
may
have
feared
could
cause
some
white
voters
to
turn
from
a
black
candidate
.

He
would
have
got
a
lot
more
done
if
he
made
up
his
mind
faster

The
key
man
seems
to
be
the
campaign
manager
,
Mr.
Lynch
.

As
a
Republican
in
an
overwhelmingly
Democratic
city
,
Mr.
Giuliani
has
an
inherent
handicap
.

To
argue
that
this
is
``
not
likely
''
to
affect
the
economy
in
positive
ways
is
contrary
both
to
recent
experience
with
capital
-
gains
tax
cuts
and
to
common
sense
.

In
that
case
,
international
banks
and
investors
incurred
big
losses
because
they
incorrectly
believed
the
company
's
debt
carried
implicit
state
guarantees
.

Indeed
,
the
potential
losses
make
any
rescue
scheme
unlikely
unless
the
politicians
once
again
change
tack
and
agree
to
pick
up
the
bill

offer
an
uneven
sample
of
the
77
-
year
-
old
Mr.
Mahfouz
's
talent
.

Mr.
Mahfouz
began
writing
when
there
was
no
novelistic
tradition
in
Arabic
,
and
he
modeled
his
work
on
Western
classics
.

The
indirectness
of
his
later
work
reflects
both
an
appetite
for
new
genres
and
the
hazards
of
art
in
the
Arab
world
.

The
main
factors
for
the
September
increase
from
the
previous
month
were
higher
prices
for
services
,
food
and
housing
.

But
Mr.
Brady
argued
that
the
SEC
is
closer
to
the
markets
and
in
a
better
position
to
understand
when
the
exchanges
are
under
such
stress
that
they
should
be
closed
.

When
President
Bush
travels
to
Costa
Rica
today
,
he
'll
go
with
little
of
the
fanfare
that
accompanies
many
of
his
foreign
travels
.

The
administration
also
made
clear
its
continuing
distate
for
the
leftist
Nicaraguan
government
in
recent
days
,
endorsing
a
package
of
electoral
aid
to
the
Nicaraguan
opposition
,
renewing
the
U.S.
trade
embargo
against
the
country
and
continuing
to
complain
that
the
country
supports
rebel
groups
in
the
region
.

One
roustabout

hanging
by
his
hands
from
a
ladder
,
bounces
his
weight
on
a
three
-
foot
wrench
to
loosen
a
stuck
fitting
.

With
all
this
,
even
the
most
wary
oil
men
agree
something
has
changed
.

``
This
is
an
opportune
time
to
find
mutual
ways
-LCB-
to
prevent
-RCB-
price
shocks
from
happening
again

But
it
wo
n't
be

boom
again

The
American
people

their

also
woke
up
too
late
to
the
menace
drugs
posed
to
the
moral
structure

This
,

But

say
she

if

for

such

forces

on
denying

and
did
not
doubt
that
``
Bare

was
a
serious
work
but
rejected
Judge

's
argument
that
the
public

could
outweigh
the

If
an

quotes

,
as
the

had
it
,
``

Judge

found
the
derivation
entirely
strained
and
writes
that
``
for

to
refer
to

is
...
a

up

That

he

,
is
critical

One

The

Jack

says
the

can
do

its

did
n't
trade
and
the
company
forecast
a
``
significant
''
drop
next
year
in
sales
of
its
core

Another
option
for
Delmed
,
the

said
,
is
that
it

sell
its

Utah

But
Rep.

-RRB-
responded
that
a
recession
could
stifle

activity

reducing
the
amount
of

It
would
contradict
that
objective
if
the
appropriations
clause

technically
a
limitation
on
legislative
power

could
be
read
as
placing
the
president
on
Congress
's
short
leash
,
making
the
executive
consist
of
the
president
and
every
member
of
Congress

President
Bush
should
veto
appropriations
acts
that
contain
these
kinds
of
unconstitutional
conditions
on
the
president
's
ability
to
discharge
his
duties

exercise

prerogatives

it

With

junk

Many

If

analysts

seeking

when
the

plans

Last

Harry
J.

the

``
One
possible
explanation
for

in

says
Mr.

,
``
is
that
the

The

Strategy

about

The

argues
that

that
it

find
in

in
an
``

''
management
reserve
that
accounts
for
undefined
programs
that
will
materialize
in
the
future
.

This
exercise
would
reveal
the
true
cost
of
a
particular

by
forcing
the
strategists
to
make
hard
decisions

is
whether

If

and
most
recently

have
cut
their
massive
circulation
rate
bases
to
eliminate
marginal
circulation
and
hold
down
rates
for
advertisers
.

In
Manhattan
,
once

desirable
store

sit
vacant

newly

been
slow

Still
,
even
that
modest

is
good
news
for
a
state
that
had

grown

to
Infotechnology

,
the
New

Financial

,
people
familiar
with
the

said
.

The

``
He

''
says
a
Western
diplomat
based
in
East
Berlin
.

The
company
already
markets
a
wide
range
of
detergents
,
food
,
household
and
health

He
added
that
``
there

to
the
economic

and
said
``
tight
monetary
policy

''

Still
others
say
,
Why
not
take
a
chance
on
a
high

octane
growth

?

The
figures
are
shocking
.

They
have
laid
out
about
$
1
billion
for
so

called
baccalaureate

-
coupon
municipal
bonds
--
so
far
offered
by
Connecticut

Illinois
,
Virginia
and
eight
other

One
problem
is
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
has
decided
that
the
investment
earnings
and
gains
of
the

are
taxable
.

He
blames

In

The
Nikkei
continued
to
gain
for
the
rest
of
the
week
,
adding
1017.69

in
four
days
--
more
than
erasing
Monday
's
losses
.

Volume
was
extremely
thin
at
351.3
million
shares
,
the
lightest
volume
of
the
week
and
modestly
under
Thursday
's
387.4
million
shares
.

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100

It
is
also
known
as
the
fraud
capital
of
the
U.S.
,
dubbed
by
investigators
and
the
media
as
the
``
Cote
de
Fraud
''
.

Because
only
a
fraction
of
them
are
ever
prosecuted
,
nobody
really
knows
how
much
money
bogus
telemarketing
operators
really
harvest
.

With
the

The

in

The

the

still
hold

but
their
stake
will
fall
to
around
30
%
after
Daimler

Benz
acquires
its
stake
in
the
concern
.

But
investors
who
are
preoccupied
with
short

fluctuations
may
be
paying
too
little
attention
to
another
big
risk
--
not
generating
enough
money
to
meet
long

There
's
a
95

Do
they
really
believe
that
the
number
is
just
for
verification
and
is
simply
a
formality
on
the

being
a

There
's
also

the

Shorn
of
all
their
riders
,
special
provisions
,
and
other
bells
and
whistles
,
insurance
policies
can
still
be
grouped
under
two
broad
categories
:
so
-
called
pure
insurance
,
which
amasses
no
cash
value
in
the
policy
and
pays
off
only
upon
death
,
and
permanent
insurance
,
which
provides
not
only
a
death
benefit
but
also
a
cash
value
in
the
policy
that
can
be
used
in
various
ways
while
the
insured
is
still
alive
.

This
is
worth
remembering
when
insurers
and
their
salesmen
try
to
sell
you
permanent
insurance
,
the
kind
that
amasses
cash
value
.

They
commonly
give
two
scenarios
:
One
is
based
on
interest
rates
that
the
company
guarantees
-LRB-
usually
4
%
to
4.5
%
-RRB-
and
the
other
on
the
rate
it
is
currently
getting
on
investment
,
often
8.5
%
or
more
.

Also
,
financial
planners
advising
on
insurance
say
that
to
their
knowledge
there
has
not
yet
been
a
tax
ruling
exempting
these
advance
payments
from
taxes

Meanwhile

said
there

transforming
itself

The
situation
was
further
aggravated
early

I
suggest
that
The
Wall
Street
Journal
-LRB-
as
well
as
other
U.S.
news
publications
of
like
mind
-RRB-
should
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
is
:
Lend
computer
equipment
to
replace
that
damaged
at
El
Espectador
,
buy
ad
space
,
publish
stories
under
the
bylines
of
El
Espectador
journalists
.

The
rogues
'
gallery
of
planners
involved
includes
some
convicted
felons
,
a
compulsive
gambler
or
two
,
various
businessmen
who
had
planned
their
own
previous
ventures
right
into
bankruptcy
,
and
one
man
who
scammed
his
wife
's
grandmother
.

So
the
SEC
has
proposed
to
Congress
that
much
of
the
job
of
oversight
be
turned
over
to
an
industry
-
funded
,
self
-
regulatory
organization
patterned
on
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
which
operates
in
the
brokerage
business
.

And
,
the
attorney
general
added
,
First
Meridian
's
president
,
Roger
V.
Sala
,
portrayed
himself
as
a
``
financial
expert
''
when
his
qualifications
largely
consisted
of
a
high
-
school
diploma
,
work
as
a
real
-
estate
and
insurance
salesman
,
and
a
stint
as
supervisor
at
a
highway
toll
booth
.

The
suit
,
he
adds
,
``
is
almost
in
the
nature
of
a
vendetta
by
a
handful
of
disgruntled
people
.
''

The
plan
is
talking
about
applicants
admitted
,
not
students
who
enroll
.

The
increase
for
national
edition
advertising
is
less
than
the
inflation
rate
and
compares
with
a
6.5
%
increase
in
1989
.

The
rewriting
was
launched
at
a
meeting
between
Mr.
Bush
and
intelligence
committee
leaders
Oct.
12
,
a
few
days
before
the
meeting
at
which
the
president
complained
about
the
rules
.

Though
the
assassination
ban
is
a
White
House
order
that
Congress
never
voted
on
,
the
intelligence
committees
can
exercise
influence
over
its
interpretation
.

Under
guidelines
included
in
an
exchange
of
letters
between
the
Reagan
administration
and
the
Senate
Intelligence
panel
last
year
,
the
U.S.
must
inform
foreign
dictators
of
plans
likely
to
endanger
their
lives

were
at
the

The
excess
heat
was
15

20
%
more
than
the
energy
involved
in

They
concluded
the
indications
of

stemmed
from
faults
in

than
from
the

Mr.
Lippens
said
the
volume

changing

has
grown
significantly

mid-September

But
it

three

a

--
and
possibly
as
much
as

--

still
exists

But
the
oil

continue
to
study
the
plan
,
and
it
will
probably
be
the
basis
for
discussion
at
next
month
's
meeting
.

At
first
it
attributed
the
slump
to
temporary
business
disruptions
,
but
when
no
orders
were
logged
in
August
and
September
,
manager
Donald
Lai
became
convinced
that
business
would
be
bad
for
many
months
.

The
Ministry
of
Foreign
Economic
Relations
and
Trade
set
up
a
special
bureau
last
month
to
monitor
the
issue
of
import
and
export
licenses
.

``
There
are
virtually
no
new
projects
,
and
that
means
no
new
business
for
us
,
''
he
says
.

As

close

The
irony
in
this
novel
is
that
neither
man
represents
a
``
safe
''
middle
-
class
haven
:
Nora
's
decision
is
between
emotional
excitement
and
emotional
security
,
with
no
firm
economic
base
anywhere
.

In
the
port
of
Berbera
,
for
example
,
hundreds
of
men
of
the
rival
Issak
clan
were
rounded
up
in
May
1988
,
imprisoned
,
and
then
taken
out
at
night
in
groups
of
five
to
50
men
to
be
executed
without
any
judicial
process
whatsoever
.

As
a
result
,
Mr.
Mengistu
has
been
forced
to
transfer
thousands
of
troops
from
Eritrea
just
to
hold
the
town
,
thereby
risking
the
loss
of
even
more
territory
in
Eritrea
only
to
keep
the
Tigreans
at
bay
.

But
the
U.S.
has
one
great
advantage
:
The
Soviets
are
universally
loathed
throughout
Ethiopia
for
what
they
did
to
the
country
this
past
decade
--
famine
and
all
.

The
fuel
-
efficient
Airbus
planes
will
be
used
largely
to
replace
Cathay

aging
fleet
of
Lockheed
Tristars
for
regional
flights
,
while
the
Boeing
aircraft
will
be
used
on
long
-
haul
routes
to
Europe
and
North
America
.

Asian
traffic
,
which
currently
accounts
for
65
%
of
Cathay

business
,
is
expected
to
continue
as
the
carrier
's
mainstay
.

As
the
government
prepares
to
release
the
next
batch
of
economic
reports
,
the
consensus
among
economists
and
money
managers
is
that
the
news
will
be
negative
.

``
Given
our
forecast
for
lower
rates
,
purchases
made
now
should
prove
quite
rewarding
before
year
end
,
''
he
said
.

But
once
the
new
securities
are
digested
,
they
expect
investors
to
focus
on
the
weak
economic
data
.

pressure
by

Last

Although
major
U.S.
manufacturers
have
all
but
ceded
the
main
segment
of
that
future
business
to
Japan

not
everyone
here
is
ready
to
give
up
.

``

They

Their

In
any
case
,
the

are
clearly
moving
faster
to
create
new

than
they
did
in
the
fall

The

represented

of
the

As

opened
yesterday
morning
on
the
Big
Board
,
stocks
of
many
of
the
nation
's
biggest
companies
could
n't
open
for
trading
because
a
wave
of
sell
orders
was
overwhelming
buyers
.

The
Federal

signaled
its
willingness
to
provide

;
the

inched

in

''
says
J.

who
runs

Japanese
were
said
to
be

Moreover
,
the
announcement
that
real
estate
magnate
and
sometime
raider
Donald
Trump
was
withdrawing
his
offer
for

might
have
been
expected
to
rattle

That

Other
Asian
and
Pacific
markets
had
sharper
losses
than
Tokyo
,
but
the
selling
wave
stopped
short
of
precipitating
another
market
crash
.

On
Oct.
16
,
1987
--
the
Friday
before
the
Black
Monday
crash
--
the
New
York
market
dropped
4.6
%
,
and
Tokyo
followed
on
Monday
with
a
2.4
%
drop
.

``
Markets
in
this
region
are
n't
so
geared
to
leveraged
buy
-
outs
,
and
their
economies
generally
are
in
good
shape
,
but
there
's
no
doubt
that
Asia
is
still
following
America
's
lead
.

Retail
investors
dumped
holdings
on
a
massive
scale
,
pushing
some
blue
-
chip
shares
down
as
much
as
20
%
.

The
first
place
to
look
under
these
circumstances
is
at
the
ways
in
which
the
sponsors
themselves
will
benefit
.

Maxus
Energy
Corp.
,
Dallas
,
said
it
discovered
a
new
oil
field
northeast
of
its
previously
discovered
Intan
Field
in
the
southeast
Sumatra
area
of
Indonesia
.

The
association
is
pushing
an
extensive
and
expensive
wish
-
list
,
which
would
substantially
boost
spending
above
the
current
level
of
more
than
$
15
billion
annually
.

Is
this
what
the
home
builders
want
?

Also
trying
to
snare
a
portion
of
the
$
2

a

is

Currently
,
the
transportation
secretary
does
n't
have
clearly
established
authority
to
block

but
can
take
the
drastic
step
of
revoking
the
operating
certificate
of
any
carrier
the
official
considers
unfit

French
President
Francois
Mitterrand
fought
to
set
a
date
for
the
conference
during
the
EC
summit
in
Madrid
last
June
,
but
the
move
was
scuttled
because
of
opposition
by
Mrs.
Thatcher
and
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
.

A
major
source
of
the
recent
strength
in
the
long
leading
indicator
has
been
the
performance
of
the
Dow
Jones
corporate
bond
-
price
index
,
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
Commerce
index
.

While
the
advance
cheered
investors
who
feared
a
1987
-
style
crash
would
occur
yesterday
,
it
was
strictly
a
big
-
stock
rally
fed
by
huge
buying
by
bargain
-
hunting
institutions
and
program
traders
.

The
onslaught
of
the
program
selling
dashed
any
hopes
that
some
of
the
big
program
trading
firms
would
hold
off
until
the
market
stabilized
.

There
was
n't
a
lot
of
panic
selling
,
either
domestically
or
internationally
...
.

Although
the
Big
Board
's
specialist
firms
struggled
through
another
highly
volatile
trading
session
,
their
performance
yesterday
was
better
than
during
Friday
's
late
-
afternoon
chaos
,
according
to
traders
and
brokers
who
work
with
them
.

Mr.
Phelan
expressed
relief
that
the
market
rebounded
yesterday
.

Crude
oil
declined
early
,
but
as
the
stock
market
retained
early
gains
,
it
,
too
,
became
stronger
,
ending
with
a
small
net
loss
.

Finally
,
according
to
Mr.
Cardillo
,
the
impact
of
the
strong
dollar
should
be
reflected
in
reduced
exports
in
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
when
the
figures
are
released
today
.

Copper
inventories
in

In
the
wake
of
Wall
Street
's
plunge
last
Friday
,
the
London
market
was
considered
especially
vulnerable
.

But
the
market
sensed
a
serious
buyer
on
a
day
dominated
by
selling
,
and
the
quotes
immediately
jumped
to
850
pence
.

Investors
here
still
expect
Ford
Motor
Co.
or
General
Motors
Corp.
to
bid
for
Jaguar
.

Even
if
that
is
so
,
however
,
it
's
probably
the
case
that
no
barriers
should
have
been
erected
to
stop
the
procession
before
the
end

If
it
is
correct
to
find
that
concerns

what
are
the

for
policy
makers
?

The
exemption
allowed
on
longer
flights
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
appears
to
be
largely
a
face
-
saving
concession
for
the
traditionally
powerful
tobacco
industry
,
which
has
found
itself
increasingly
isolated
in
the
face
of
public
pressure
in
recent
years

The
sum

But
markets
can
operate
with
greater
or
lesser
efficiency
.

To
achieve
maximum
liquidity
and
minimize
price
volatility
,
either
all
markets
should
be
open
to
trading
or
none

"
I

it

The

that

Uchikoshi
said
,
according
to
the
agency
"
U.
B.
A.
,
"
that
they
were
stunned
when
they
discovered
he
was
still
alive
.

It
therefore
rests
on
the
principle
of
consensual
democracy
,
and
the
shared
-
living
agreement
is
an
unavoidable
fait
accompli
.

All
I
ask
for
is
there
in
the
constitution
.

He
clarified
that
the
United

had
resorted
to
setting
up
international
courts
in
other
parts
of
the
world
such
as
Sierra
Leone
and
the
former
Yugoslavia
because
"
the
courts
there
had
collapsed
but
our
courts
are
independent
and
fair
and
so
we
will
not
agree
to
any
Syrian
citizen
being
brought
before
an
international
court
because
we
have
confidence
in
our
courts
"

The

after
remains
of

in
London
which
Litvinenko
had
visited
.

He
added
that
the
international
community
and
Israel
are
asking
us
to
recognize
the
theft
of
our
land
,
to
stop
jihad
and
resistance
,
and
to
respect
previously
signed
agreements
,
confirming
that
these
things
will
never
happen
.

What
is
noticeable
is
that
the
murderers
target
the
youth
who
have
a
role
to
play
in
the
country

future
and
who
follow
the
principles
that
Pierre
Gemayel
followed
which
are
independence

And
perhaps
some
might
argue
that
President
Carter
did
not
speak
as
forcefully
and
dare
to
confront
the
Jewish
lobby
until
after
he
left
power
,
and
is
nearing
the
last
stages
of
his
senior

is

For

,
in

,
mergers
of
US
steel
mills
directly
led
to
the
birth
of
a
few
large

unified
steel
companies
,
but
these
companies
also
faced
serious
threats
from
small

steel
mills
,
which
are
flexible
in
operation
and
advanced
in
technology
.

However
,
this

are
from

Moreover

With

produced

if

and
the

to
stop

,
and
create
conditions
for

Some

Increasing
the
export

one
of

which
foreign

Kazuo

,
Director

said
here
today
that
the
real
growth
rate
of
the

economy
in
1998
will
be
about
3
%
.

Recently
,
the
Bank
of

provided

of
20

.

This
project
has
invested
around
6
billion
yuan
RMB
,
and
upon
completion
,
will
change
the
state
of
transferring
almost
all
the
needed
chemical
raw

from
other
places
to
the
areas
of
Chongqing
and

Recently
,
China
advocated
using
the
textile
industry
as
a
point
of
breakthrough
in
state
-
owned
enterprise
reform
and
problem
resolution
.

At
the
same
time
,
more
than
15
%
of
the
agreement
quota
volume
for
textile
products
exported
to
Europe
and
the
US
will
be
assigned
to
self

Binggang
Zhu
expressed
that
,
China
would
continue
to
expand
the
opening
up
to
the
outside
and
accelerate
the
pace
of
cooperation
with
the
outside
.

The
White
Paper
said
,
since
the
90's
,
one
of
the
important
ingredients
of
the
growth
of
China
's
foreign
trade
exports
was
the
expansion
of
processing
trade
exports
.

He
works
for
the
masses
and
firstly
,
is
not
afraid
of
suffering
loss
,
secondly
,
is
not
afraid
of
hardship
,
and
thirdly
,
is
not
afraid
of
being
blamed
.

The
joy
lies
in
that
the
total
amount
of
foreign
trade
still
maintains
a
strong
growth
momentum
,
and
has
realized
trade
surpluses
for
the
third
year
in
a
row
,
whereas
the
sorrow
is
that
the
amount
of
trade
surplus
has
sharply
reversed
,
and
this
year
,
a
relatively
large
deficit
may
appear
.

For
instance
,
Asian
currency
devaluation
will
decrease
export
competitiveness
,
and
the
fall
of
oil
price
will
significantly
reduce
oil
revenues
.

According
to
presentations
,
it
has
been
15
years
now
since
1982
,
when
China
first
issued
overseas
debt
.

While
expressing
agreement
to
provide
co-operation
,
France
expressed
that
they
would
end
the
military
agreement
with
Chad
.

By
listing
stocks
,
actual
money
raised
domestically
and
overseas
by
enterprises
last
year
reached
about
130
billion
yuan
and
the
State
gave
capital
support
through
partially
refunding
income
taxes
to
enterprises
that
undertook
State
owned
enterprise
reform
.

Last
year
,
the
exports
of
foreign
-
invested
enterprises
to
Japan
were
14.9
billion
US
dollars
,
up
35.4
%
,
and
accounted
for
48
%
of
China
's
exports
to
Japan
;
imports
were
19.5
billion
US
dollars
,
up
14.7
%
,
and
accounted
for
67
%
of
China
's
total
import
value
from
Japan
.

The
Southern
Anhui
Incident
that
happened
fifty
years
ago
was
a
tragedy
that
shocked
China
and
foreign
countries
.

The
actual
realization
rate
of
foreign
merchant
investments
ranks
first
in
the
nation
.

This
was
pointed
out
today
by
Tianjin
's
vice-Mayor
,
Disheng
Ye
,
when
he
made
a
thematic
investment
report
for
the
'97
MBA

group
of

Now
,

owns
the
most
advanced
automobile
technology
development
center
,
each
year
will
have
a
variety
of
new
products
coming
to
market
,
and
is
better
suited
to
changes
in
China
's
transportation
structure
.

On
the
part
of
the
government
,
the
keynote
of
a
moderately
tight
macro-economic
policy
will
not
be
changed
.
